You are inside a new nextjs project ok? it's inside <bible-quizzes-christian-2025>, you will have to cd into this directory to do things, i am on windows powershell so don't use && symbols

  ✅ PROJECT GOAL
  I want to create a stunning Next.js project, statically generated, using Next.js 14.2.23, with the following features:

  Quiz categories
  Nav bar

  /public/images/ folder already contains relevant images

  It is a content-based website for a platform that offers Bible quizzes — this site must be fast, educational, and easy to navigate for users of all ages and skill levels. The language is English only.

  🎨 UI/UX DESIGN
  Use the images in an intelligent and purposeful way to build a modern, elegant website with a clean but rich interface.

  You must implement:

  * A cohesive color palette that enhances focus and trust
  * Font pairings that are readable but distinctive
  * Modular layout with vertical blocks
  * Icons and SVG illustrations
  * Responsive design with no horizontal scrolling on mobile
  * Mobile navigation MUST NOT cover more than 70% of screen space
  * Preserve minimum 30% screen visibility for content behind menus

Use Next.js 14.2.23 – these were my install settings:

Create icons and svgs as you’re going – start with something simple.

Do not use the src directory.

Implement ISR so the website can be built again quickly and easily.

Use NextJS and Tailwind to make a unique, beautiful, modern, modular website with 5–7 unique vertical blocks per page (more on the homepage).

Be very careful and wary of TypeScript errors.

TYPESCRIPT & ERROR PREVENTION (CRITICAL):
- Define proper interfaces for Quiz, QuizQuestion, and all data structures
- Use strict type checking for all props and state variables
- Ensure all imported functions and components have proper return types
- Handle undefined/null cases explicitly in all data access
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators
- Validate all dynamic data before rendering
- Check for missing properties in quiz data before component initialization
- Use TypeScript strict mode and fix ALL compilation errors before deployment

COMMON ERROR PATTERNS TO AVOID:
- Missing properties in quiz objects (questions, time, difficulty, isBookQuiz)
- Undefined variables accessed outside their scope
- Conditional rendering mismatches between server and client
- Browser API usage during SSR (window, document, localStorage)
- State initialization that differs between server and client renders

Make sure you are using generateStaticParams – and not confusing dynamic generation with static generation.

Maximize build efficiency, speed, and the complexity and modular nature of any pages which are generated for SEO.

Ensure to implement all slugs etc. programmatically, and never create an index page link without creating the index page itself.

You must be as detailed as possible with your SEO, abusing the fact that Google is very likely to rank pages that have exact phrase matches to keywords. For example, “Genesis 1 KJV Quiz” or “Hard Bible Quiz on Psalms,” which helps us rank for these exact questions. You can see how index pages, and then individual pages of that page type, can really start to create scale.

Quiz URL Structure & Hierarchy


 SEO Structure

  Title Pattern:
  - Quiz pages: [Book Name] [Chapter Number] Quiz - SalvationCall
  - Consistent branding with site name
  - Clear, descriptive titles matching search intent

  H1 Structure:
  - Always matches the page title exactly
  - Format: [Book Name] [Chapter Number] Quiz

 Schema Markup (MANDATORY JSON-LD IMPLEMENTATION):
  - Use JSON-LD format for all structured data (NOT microdata or RDFa)
  - Quiz schema for rich snippets and search features
  - FAQ schema for common questions and answer boxes
  - Educational content markup for learning resources
  - Breadcrumb schema for navigation hierarchy
  - Organization schema for site authority
  - WebPage schema for all quiz pages

 Programmatic SEO Strategy

  Scalable Content Generation:
  1. Biblical Books: All 66 books of the Bible
  2. Chapter-by-Chapter: Individual quizzes for each chapter
  3. Cross-References: Related quizzes and topics
  4. Multiple Formats: Multiple choice, fill-in-blank, themed

Content Templates:
  - Standardized quiz format across all pages
  - Consistent introduction text
  - Uniform question structure
  - Identical sharing and navigation elements

  ├── Previous chapter quiz: "← [Book] Chapter [X-1] Quiz"
  ├── Next chapter quiz: "[Book] Chapter [X+1] Quiz →"
  ├── Full book quiz: "Take the complete [Book] Quiz"
  ├── Character studies mentioned in chapter
  └── Main quiz hub: "Browse all Bible Quizzes"

  IMPLEMENTATION: Add contextual navigation section in quiz results area with
  blue background, grid layout, and appropriate icons for each link type.

  REACT/NEXT.JS ERROR PREVENTION RULES:
  - Always use 'use client' for components with useState, useEffect, or event handlers
  - Initialize state consistently between server and client renders
  - Move useState declarations AFTER all variable definitions to prevent initialization errors
  - Use useEffect for client-side only operations (timers, browser APIs)
  - Avoid conditional hooks - all hooks must be called in the same order every render
  - Handle loading states properly to prevent undefined data access
  - Use proper error boundaries for graceful error handling
  - Test every interactive component for hydration consistency

Quiz Production System & Workflow

  Content Creation Process

  Phase 1: Research & Planning

  For Each Quiz:
  1. Source Material Review
     ├── Read chapter/topic thoroughly
     ├── Identify key themes and characters
     ├── Note important verses and events
     └── Research historical/cultural context

  2. Question Planning (16-25 Questions MANDATORY)
     ├── Chapter quizzes: EXACTLY 16-20 questions
     ├── Book quizzes: EXACTLY 20-25 questions
     ├── 40% Easy questions (direct facts)
     ├── 40% Medium questions (understanding)
     ├── 20% Hard questions (application)
     └── Balance across chapter content

  3. Keyword Research
     ├── Primary: "[book] chapter [x] quiz"
     ├── Secondary: Related character names
     ├── Long-tail: Specific events/themes
     └── Competition analysis

  Phase 2: Question Development

  Question Writing Guidelines:
  ├── Use clear, unambiguous language
  ├── Avoid trick questions
  ├── Include direct Scripture references
  ├── Balance factual and application questions
  ├── Test one concept per question
  └── Ensure one clearly correct answer

  Quality Control Checklist:
  ├── Factual accuracy verified
  ├── Grammar and spelling checked
  ├── Difficulty level appropriate
  ├── Cultural sensitivity reviewed
  └── Educational value confirmed

  Phase 3: Technical Implementation

  Page Creation Process:
  1. URL Generation: /[book]-[chapter]-quiz/
  2. SEO Elements: Title, meta description, JSON-LD schema markup
  3. Content Assembly: Intro + Questions + Related links
  4. LINEAR QUIZ IMPLEMENTATION: Ensure chapter quizzes bypass description pages
  5. Testing: Functionality, mobile responsiveness, linear quiz flow
  6. Internal Linking: Connect to hub and related pages
  7. Analytics Setup: Track completion rates and scores

  CRITICAL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  - Chapter quiz pages must initialize with showQuiz=true (no landing page)
  - All questions rendered simultaneously on page load
  - Submit button appears at bottom after all questions
  - Book-level quizzes can have description pages, chapter quizzes cannot
  - Use conditional logic: if (quiz.type === 'chapter') { showQuiz = true }

  QUIZ UX ENHANCEMENT TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

  Progress Indicator Implementation:
  ├── Create ProgressBar component with current/total question count
  ├── Use React state to track answered questions: const [answered, setAnswered] = useState(0)
  ├── Calculate percentage: const progress = (answered / totalQuestions) * 100
  ├── Display format: "Question {currentQuestion} of {totalQuestions}"
  ├── Add visual progress bar: <div className="w-full bg-gray-200 rounded-full h-2">
  ├── Update progress on answer selection: setAnswered(prev => prev + 1)
  └── Show estimated time remaining based on average completion time

  Mixed Question Format Implementation:
  ├── Create QuestionType enum: 'multiple-choice' | 'true-false' | 'fill-blank'
  ├── Add questionType property to QuizQuestion interface
  ├── Implement conditional rendering based on question type
  ├── TrueFalseQuestion component for binary choices
  ├── FillBlankQuestion component with input validation
  ├── MultipleChoiceQuestion component (existing format)
  ├── Distribute question types: 70% MC, 20% T/F, 10% other
  └── Ensure consistent scoring across all question types

  Accessibility Implementation:
  ├── Add ARIA labels: aria-label="Quiz progress" aria-describedby="progress-text"
  ├── Keyboard navigation: onKeyDown handlers for Tab, Enter, Arrow keys
  ├── Focus management: useRef and focus() for question navigation
  ├── Screen reader announcements: aria-live="polite" for progress updates
  ├── High contrast mode support: CSS custom properties for colors
  ├── Skip links: <a href="#quiz-content" className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only">
  ├── Semantic HTML: <fieldset> for question groups, <legend> for instructions
  └── Voice-over testing on iOS Safari and Android TalkBack

  Mobile Performance Implementation:
  ├── Lazy loading: React.lazy() for non-critical components
  ├── Image optimization: next/image with responsive sizes
  ├── Bundle splitting: Dynamic imports for quiz-specific code
  ├── Service worker: Cache quiz data for offline access
  ├── Touch optimization: CSS touch-action and pointer-events
  ├── Viewport optimization: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
  ├── Font loading: font-display: swap for web fonts
  └── Performance monitoring: Core Web Vitals tracking

  HYDRATION ERROR PREVENTION (MANDATORY):
  - Use 'use client' directive for all interactive components
  - Initialize state AFTER determining quiz type to prevent hydration mismatches
  - Avoid conditional rendering that differs between server and client
  - Use useEffect for client-side only logic (timers, localStorage, etc.)
  - Ensure useState initialization is consistent between server and client
  - Never use browser-only APIs (window, localStorage) during initial render
  - Use suppressHydrationWarning sparingly and only when necessary
  - Test all quiz pages for hydration errors in development mode
