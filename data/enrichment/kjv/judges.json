all these drew the sword.","20:26":"and all the people","20:27":"","20:28":"the son of Eleazar","20:29":"And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.","20:30":"and set themselves in array against Gibeah","20:31":"and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike and kill of the people","20:32":"They are struck down before us","20:33":"and set themselves in array at Baal Tamar:  and the ambushers of Israel broke forth out of their place","20:34":"and the battle was sore; but they didn't know that evil was close on them.","20:35":"And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.","20:36":"because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.","20:37":"and rushed on Gibeah; and the ambushers drew themselves along","20:38":"Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait","20:39":"and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said","20:40":"the Benjamites looked behind them; and behold","20:41":"and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that evil had come on them.","20:42":"Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness;

all these were men of valor.","20:47":"and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months.","20:48":"and struck them with the edge of the sword","21:1":"saying","21:2":"and sat there until evening before God","21:3":"Yahweh","21:4":"and built there an altar","21:5":"Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who didn't come up in the assembly to Yahweh?
