          "explanation": "Isaiah 58:3 records the people's complaint that their fasting is unseen by God. This reflects a misunderstanding of fasting's purpose, similar to the warnings in Matthew 6:16-18 and Zechariah 7:5-6, where fasting without true repentance and justice is rejected by God. True fasting is about heart transformation (Joel 2:12-13).",

This aligns with God's rejection of empty ritual in Hosea 6:6, Micah 6:6-8, and Jesus' teaching that mercy is better than sacrifice (Matthew 9:13). Genuine fasting involves justice and mercy.",
