          ],
          "correctAnswer": "To provide refuge for one who kills unintentionally",
          "explanation": "Deuteronomy 19:2-3 commands that three cities be set apart so that anyone who kills another unintentionally may flee there and live. This reflects God's provision for mercy and justice, consistent with Numbers 35:9-15 and the principle of protecting the innocent.

          "explanation": "Verse 12 states that if a man kills intentionally, the elders shall deliver him to the avenger of blood so he may die.

          "correctAnswer": "It establishes proportional justice and limits excessive punishment",
          "explanation": "Verse 21 teaches lex talionis, the law of retaliation, which limits punishment to be proportional to the offense, preventing escalation of violence. This concept is foundational in biblical justice seen also in Exodus 21:24-25 and Leviticus 24:19-20, and finds fulfillment in Jesus' teaching on mercy in Matthew 5:38-42.",

          "correctAnswer": "Unintentional killing without previous hatred",
          "explanation": "Verse 4 clarifies that the slayer who can flee is one who kills unintentionally and did not hate the victim before. This distinction upholds the sanctity of life while offering mercy for accidental sin, also taught in Numbers 35:11-28 and reflected in Jesus’ distinction between sin and intentional rebellion (John 8:7).",
