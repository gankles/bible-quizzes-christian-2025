          "correctAnswer": "To prevent the uncircumcised from abusing him",
          "explanation": "Saul feared abuse by the Philistines, referred to as the uncircumcised, which in biblical terms often signifies those outside the covenant community (1 Chronicles 10:4).

This echoes similar responses to defeat in Israel’s history, such as in Judges 7:21-22, and reflects the consequences of sin and leadership failure (Psalm 78:9-11).",
