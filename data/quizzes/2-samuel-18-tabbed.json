This reflects God's attribute of mercy (Exodus 34:6), Jesus' teaching to love enemies (Matthew 5:44), and the apostolic call to forgive (Ephesians 4:32).

This aligns with Scripture teaching that sin brings death (Romans 6:23), and that God's judgment can manifest in various forms (Exodus 15:9; 2 Chronicles 20:22).
