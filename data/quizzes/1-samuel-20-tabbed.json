          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "Jonathan shows steadfast loyalty and covenant faithfulness to David",

            "Jonathan advises David to flee without support"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Jonathan shows steadfast loyalty and covenant faithfulness to David",
          "explanation": "Jonathan makes a covenant with David (1 Samuel 20:16), loves him as his own soul (1 Samuel 20:17), and promises to protect him by warning him of Saul's intentions (1 Samuel 20:12-13). This demonstrates Jonathan's loyalty, which reflects biblical themes of covenant faithfulness found throughout Scripture (Genesis 9:9-17, Ruth 1:16-17, Proverbs 17:17, John 15:13).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "It marks the time when David would normally eat with King Saul",
          "explanation": "David states he should not fail to sit with the king at meat during the new moon (1 Samuel 20:5). This timing is crucial for testing Saul's attitude toward David (1 Samuel 20:18-25). The new moon as a sacred time is consistent with biblical calendar observances (Numbers 28:11-15; Ezekiel 46:1; 2 Samuel 1:18).",

          "correctAnswer": "Shooting three arrows and sending a boy to retrieve them",
          "explanation": "Jonathan plans to shoot three arrows and send a boy to find them; depending on where the arrows fall, David will know if it is safe to return or if danger awaits (1 Samuel 20:19-22). This covert signaling reflects wisdom and care for David's life, aligning with biblical themes of protective friendship and divine providence (Psalm 91:3-7; Proverbs 27:17; Ecclesiastes 4:9-10).",

This reveals Saul's sinful jealousy and murderous intent, consistent with the biblical motif of the wicked ruler opposing God’s anointed (Psalm 2:1-3; Acts 4:25-26; Hebrews 11:32-34).",
