This motif of lament and tears is present in Job 3:24 and Jeremiah 9:1 where tears express grief. Jesus wept at Lazarus' death (John 11:35) illustrating the biblical acknowledgment of sorrow in faith. The Psalms themselves emphasize tears as part of the believer’s experience (Psalm 56:8).",

          "correctAnswer": "Going with the multitude to the house of God",
          "explanation": "The psalmist remembers joining the multitude in joyful worship at the house of God, which brought him spiritual nourishment and joy. This reflects the importance of corporate worship seen in Leviticus 23:4-44 and Hebrews 10:25, where assembling with the saints is encouraged. The psalmist contrasts current sorrow with past joy, a theme also found in Nehemiah 8:10 and Acts 2:46.",

This encouragement to hope is echoed in Romans 5:5 which states hope does not put us to shame, and Lamentations 3:21-23 which speaks of hope as a sustaining force. Psalm 33:18 also speaks of the Lord watching over those who hope in Him, reaffirming hope as an essential act of faith.",

          "explanation": "Psalms 42:6 declares that even from distant and difficult places such as Jordan, Hermon, and Mizar, the psalmist will remember God. This illustrates the truth that God is omnipresent and worthy of remembrance everywhere (Psalm 139:7-10).

This evokes similar biblical imagery of chaos and distress in Job 38:16 and Jeremiah 51:42. It highlights the believer’s experience of deep affliction in faith, as seen in 2 Corinthians 1:8-9 where Paul describes being burdened beyond strength.",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "The LORD’s lovingkindness and song",
          "explanation": "The psalmist expresses confidence that God's lovingkindness will be commanded by day, and His song will be with him by night, symbolizing continuous divine presence and comfort. This is consistent with Psalm 89:1 which speaks of singing of God’s steadfast love forever, and Lamentations 3:22-23 about God's mercy being new every morning. The New Testament similarly affirms God's constant care (Romans 8:38-39).",

          "explanation": "The psalmist addresses God as his rock and questions why God seems to have forgotten him. This cry is similar to Psalm 22:1 where the psalmist feels forsaken, and also to Habakkuk 1:2 questioning God’s apparent silence. The term 'rock' emphasizes God's strength and reliability (Deuteronomy 32:4). The lament reflects the human experience of feeling abandoned yet still addressing God.",

This metaphor of internal anguish echoes Jeremiah 20:9 and Job 19:2. It also reflects the New Testament teaching on suffering for righteousness (1 Peter 4:14) and Jesus’ own experience of reproach (Hebrews 12:3).",

          "correctAnswer": "Where is thy God?",
          "explanation": "The enemies mockingly ask 'Where is thy God?' challenging the psalmist's faith during adversity. This question appears in both verses 3 and 10, reflecting a common challenge to believers in distress (Job 1:9-11). Jesus faced similar taunts during his passion (Matthew 27:43). The psalmist’s response is an implicit defense of God’s presence despite appearances.",
