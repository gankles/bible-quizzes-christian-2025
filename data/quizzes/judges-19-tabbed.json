          "correctAnswer": "She played the whore against him",
          "explanation": "The phrase 'played the whore against him' in Judges 19:2 indicates unfaithfulness, reflecting human sinfulness and broken covenant relationships. This theme of covenant unfaithfulness is echoed in Hosea 1:2 and Ezekiel 16:15, illustrating the spiritual and social decay in Israel.",
