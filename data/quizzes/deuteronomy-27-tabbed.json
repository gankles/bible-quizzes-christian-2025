          ],
          "correctAnswer": "To write all the words of the law upon them",
          "explanation": "Deuteronomy 27:2-3 instructs the Israelites to set up great stones and plaster them so that all the words of the law could be written plainly on them. This served as a public declaration of God's covenant. Similarly, in Exodus 24:12, God gave Moses the tablets of the covenant law, and in Psalm 119:11, the law is treasured in the heart to avoid sin. In the New Testament, Jesus affirms the law's authority (Matthew 5:17), and Paul emphasizes obedience to God's word (Romans 2:13).",

          "correctAnswer": "Mount Ebal",
          "explanation": "Deuteronomy 27:4-5 commands the people to set up the stones and build the altar on Mount Ebal after crossing the Jordan. This location was significant for covenant renewal. Mount Gerizim is mentioned in the next verses as the place of blessing (Deut 27:12). The significance of sacred mountains is echoed in Exodus 19:20 and Hebrews 12:18. The altar built without iron tools (Deut 27:5) symbolizes purity, consistent with other altar instructions (Exodus 20:25).",

          "explanation": "Deuteronomy 27:6 specifies that the altar must be built of whole stones, without breaking them, symbolizing completeness and holiness. This mirrors the instruction in Exodus 20:25 and reflects the theme of purity in worship. The use of unbroken stones prefigures Christ's sinless sacrifice (1 Peter 1:19) and the call to offer ourselves as living stones in spiritual worship (1 Peter 2:5).",

          "explanation": "In Deuteronomy 27:15-26, after each curse, the people respond 'Amen,' signifying their solemn agreement and acknowledgment of the covenant consequences. This communal affirmation emphasizes corporate responsibility and covenant obedience, a key biblical theme (Numbers 14:28; Nehemiah 8:6). The New Testament encourages believers to affirm God’s word with sincere hearts (Romans 1:5; 1 Corinthians 14:16).",

          "correctAnswer": "Idolatry and deception",
          "explanation": "Deuteronomy 27:15 curses anyone who makes an idol and hides it, condemning secret idolatry and deception. This reflects God's command against idolatry throughout Scripture (Exodus 20:4-5; Isaiah 44:9-20) and highlights the holiness of God who demands exclusive worship (1 Corinthians 10:14). Jesus reiterates this when teaching against idols of the heart (Matthew 6:24).",

This upholds God’s justice and neighbor-love commands (Leviticus 19:14; Proverbs 22:28). Jesus teaches the principle of loving one’s neighbor (Matthew 22:39), and the New Testament calls for respect of others’ possessions (Ephesians 4:28).",

          "correctAnswer": "Because he uncovereth his father's skirt",
          "explanation": "Deuteronomy 27:20 states the curse is because the man 'uncovereth his father's skirt,' a metaphor for violating family honor and covenant boundaries. This illustrates God's design for family purity and respect (Leviticus 18:8). Such prohibitions highlight God's holiness and order, echoed in the New Testament's calls for sexual purity (Hebrews 13:4).",

          "correctAnswer": "No iron tool is to be lifted upon them",
          "explanation": "Deuteronomy 27:5 forbids the use of iron tools on the altar stones, signifying the altar's sanctity and purity. This prohibition is found in Exodus 20:25 and symbolizes that the altar is dedicated to God, untainted by human weapons or instruments of death. This foreshadows Christ's pure and unblemished sacrifice (1 Peter 1:19).",
