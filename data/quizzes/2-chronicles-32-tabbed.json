          "question": "According to 2 Chronicles 32, what was Hezekiah's primary reason for stopping the waters of the fountains outside Jerusalem?",
          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "To prevent the Assyrians from finding water during the siege",
            "To create a moat around the city",
            "To provide water only for the priests",
            "To irrigate the fields outside the city"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "To prevent the Assyrians from finding water during the siege",
          "explanation": "Hezekiah stopped the waters so the king of Assyria would not find much water, as stated in 2 Chronicles 32:3-4. This demonstrates God's providential protection over Jerusalem, consistent with God's care for His people (Exodus 17:6; Isaiah 33:16; John 4:14; Revelation 7:17).",

          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "The LORD our God to help us and fight our battles",

            "His alliances with other nations"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "The LORD our God to help us and fight our battles",
          "explanation": "Hezekiah encouraged the people by affirming that God was with them to fight their battles (2 Chronicles 32:7-8). This reflects the biblical doctrine of God's omnipotence and providential care (Exodus 14:14; Deuteronomy 20:4; Romans 8:31; Psalm 46:1).",

            "No god of any nation had been able to deliver their people from Assyria",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "No god of any nation had been able to deliver their people from Assyria",
          "explanation": "Sennacherib’s servants argued that no god of other nations could deliver their people from Assyria, so Hezekiah’s God could not either (2 Chronicles 32:13-15). This reflects a common ancient Near Eastern challenge to the sovereignty of Israel’s God, answered by the biblical affirmation of Yahweh’s unique power and faithfulness (Exodus 15:11; Isaiah 45:5-7; Jeremiah 10:10; 1 Corinthians 8:6).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He sent an angel to destroy the mighty men of Assyria",
          "explanation": "God sent an angel who cut off the leaders and captains in the Assyrian camp, leading to Sennacherib’s shameful return and eventual death (2 Chronicles 32:21). This demonstrates divine intervention and protection of His covenant people (Exodus 12:23; Psalm 34:7; 2 Kings 19:35; Hebrews 1:14).",

            "He converted to the God of Israel"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He was killed by his own sons in the house of his god",
          "explanation": "After returning in shame, Sennacherib was slain by his own sons in the house of his god (2 Chronicles 32:21). This reflects the biblical theme of divine judgment against pride and idolatry (Isaiah 10:12; Daniel 4:30-37; Psalm 75:7; Romans 12:19).",

            "God controls the rise and fall of kings and nations",

            "God’s power is limited by political alliances"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "God controls the rise and fall of kings and nations",
          "explanation": "The chapter shows God saving Jerusalem by defeating Assyria and orchestrating Sennacherib’s death, demonstrating His sovereign control over history (2 Chronicles 32:21-22). This aligns with Scripture teaching God’s sovereignty over nations (Daniel 2:21; Proverbs 21:1; Romans 13:1; Revelation 17:17).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "His heart was lifted up in pride, and wrath came upon him",
          "explanation": "Though Hezekiah prayed and was healed (2 Chronicles 32:24), later his heart was lifted up in pride, bringing wrath upon him and Judah (2 Chronicles 32:25). This teaches about human sinfulness and the danger of pride (Proverbs 16:18; 1 Corinthians 10:12; James 4:6; Galatians 6:3).",
