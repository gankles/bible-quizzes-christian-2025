          "explanation": "Isaiah 15:3 states that the people gird themselves with sackcloth, a biblical symbol of mourning, repentance, and humility before God (Jonah 3:5; Esther 4:1). This shows their awareness of divine judgment and their grief over their sinfulness.",

          "explanation": "Isaiah 15:4 mentions that Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, and their voices reach Jahaz. This signifies widespread distress caused by judgment. The motif of cities crying out in judgment is echoed in Jeremiah 48:30 and Lamentations 2:11, reflecting the communal impact of sin and God's punishment.",

          "explanation": "Isaiah 15:5 says the fugitives of Moab flee to Zoar, described metaphorically as an 'heifer of three years old.' Zoar is a place of refuge, as seen also in Genesis 19:20-22 during the destruction of Sodom. This illustrates God's sovereign control over places of refuge and judgment.",

          "explanation": "Isaiah 15:9 states that the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood, symbolizing violent judgment and death. This is reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7:20) and prophetic imagery of divine wrath (Revelation 16:3). It shows God's sovereign punishment on sin.",
