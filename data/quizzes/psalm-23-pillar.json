      ],
      "correctAnswer": "The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want",
      "explanation": "Psalm 23:1 begins with the famous declaration 'The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.' David uses the personal pronoun 'my' — this is not an abstract theological statement but a personal relationship with God as provider and protector.",

    {
      "id": "ps23-q2",

      "correctAnswer": "In green pastures",
      "explanation": "Psalm 23:2 says, 'He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.' Green pastures represent abundant provision and rest — a shepherd leads his flock to the best grazing land.",

      "correctAnswer": "True",
      "explanation": "Sheep are afraid of rushing water and will not drink from fast-moving streams. A good shepherd leads them to still, calm waters where they can drink safely. This pictures God leading His people to places of peace and spiritual refreshment.",

      "difficulty": "easy"
    },

      "correctAnswer": "Goodness and mercy",
      "explanation": "'Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.' The Hebrew word for 'follow' (radaph) actually means 'to pursue' — God's goodness and mercy actively chase after David, not merely trailing behind.",

      "explanation": "David was a literal shepherd before becoming king of Israel (1 Samuel 16:11, 17:34-36). He tended his father Jesse's sheep in Bethlehem and defended them against lions and bears. This firsthand experience gives Psalm 23 its vivid, authentic imagery.",
