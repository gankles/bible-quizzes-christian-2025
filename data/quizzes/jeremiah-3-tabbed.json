          "explanation": "Jeremiah 3:6 describes Israel’s idolatry as taking place on every high mountain and under every green tree, symbolic of pagan worship sites (Deuteronomy 12:2-3). This highlights their persistent covenant breaking. Similar imagery appears in 2 Kings 17:10 and Ezekiel 6:13. The use of natural landmarks for idolatry shows the depth of Israel’s departure from exclusive worship of Yahweh (Exodus 20:4-5).",

          "explanation": "Jeremiah 3:7-8 reveals Judah’s treachery as they imitate Israel’s unfaithfulness without fear. This shows the spread of covenant unfaithfulness to both kingdoms (Ezekiel 23:3-5). It underlines humanity’s propensity to sin and resist repentance (Romans 1:21-23).

This covenant marriage metaphor appears in Hosea 2:19-20 and Ezekiel 16:8. The New Testament reflects this in Christ’s relationship with the Church as the bridegroom (Ephesians 5:25-27).

This highlights divine provision of spiritual leaders (Ezekiel 34:23-24). Jesus is the Good Shepherd (John 10:11), and the New Testament calls leaders to shepherd the flock with care (1 Peter 5:2-3).

This eschatological vision echoes Isaiah 2:3 and Zechariah 8:3. Revelation 21:2-3 depicts the New Jerusalem where God dwells with His people.

This restoration theme is central in Ezekiel 37:15-28 and Isaiah 11:12. It prefigures the Messianic age where God's people are gathered from exile (Acts 15:16-17).

This imagery highlights the personal and covenantal nature of sin (Hosea 2:7). It underscores the depth of Israel's unfaithfulness and God's sorrow (Isaiah 54:6).
