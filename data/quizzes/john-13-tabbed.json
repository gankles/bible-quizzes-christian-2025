          "correctAnswer": "That you love one another as I have loved you",
          "explanation": "John 13:34 presents the new commandment to love one another with the same love Jesus showed, emphasizing sacrificial and self-giving love. This love is central to Jesus’ teaching (Matthew 22:37-40), is echoed in 1 John 4:7-12, and fulfills the law (Romans 13:8-10).",

          "explanation": "John 13:38 predicts Peter’s triple denial before the rooster crows, which is fulfilled in the Passion narratives (Matthew 26:69-75, Luke 22:54-62). This underlines human weakness and the necessity of divine grace for perseverance (Psalm 51:17; 2 Corinthians 12:9).",
