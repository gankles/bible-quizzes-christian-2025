          "question": "What was Ahithophel's counsel regarding the pursuit of David?",
          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "To choose twelve thousand men and pursue David immediately",
            "To gather all Israel and confront David directly",
            "To fortify the city and wait for David to come to them",
            "To send spies to monitor David's movements"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "To choose twelve thousand men and pursue David immediately",
          "explanation": "Ahithophel advised Absalom to select twelve thousand men to pursue David immediately at night to catch him weary and strike only the king (2 Samuel 17:1-3). This counsel reflects decisive military strategy and the desire to end the conflict swiftly, consistent with God's providence in directing the outcomes of human plans (Proverbs 19:21, Isaiah 10:5-6, Romans 8:28, James 4:13-15).",

          "question": "How did Hushai describe David and his men to Absalom?",
          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "As weary and weak-handed",
            "As mighty men, like a bear robbed of her whelps",
            "As easily frightened and disorganized",
            "As hiding in a city awaiting attack"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "As mighty men, like a bear robbed of her whelps",
          "explanation": "Hushai portrayed David and his men as fierce and valiant warriors, comparing their anger to a bear robbed of her cubs, and emphasized David’s experience in warfare (2 Samuel 17:8). This imagery communicates the divine empowerment of God's anointed and those who stand with him (Psalm 18:39, Isaiah 41:10, Hebrews 11:34, Ephesians 6:10).",

          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "David and his men are mighty and will not be easily overcome",
            "The twelve thousand men were not enough to pursue David",
            "David was hidden in a well and could not be found",
            "The elders of Israel opposed Ahithophel's plan"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "David and his men are mighty and will not be easily overcome",
          "explanation": "Hushai argued that David’s men were mighty and valiant, and that an immediate attack would fail because David would not lodge with the people but be prepared for battle (2 Samuel 17:7-10). This reflects the biblical principle that God strengthens his servants for the challenges they face (Psalm 144:1-2, Isaiah 40:29-31, 2 Corinthians 12:9, Philippians 4:13).",

            "Gather all Israel from Dan to Beersheba and go to battle in person",
            "Send spies to infiltrate David's camp",
            "Build fortifications around their cities",
            "Offer peace negotiations to David"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Gather all Israel from Dan to Beersheba and go to battle in person",
          "explanation": "Hushai counseled Absalom to gather the whole army and personally lead the battle against David (2 Samuel 17:11). This counsel misled Absalom but illustrates how human plans can be thwarted by God's sovereign will (Proverbs 16:9, Isaiah 14:27, Romans 9:19-21, James 1:13-15).",

          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "They preferred Hushai's counsel over Ahithophel's",
            "They rejected both counsels and sought a third opinion",
            "They followed Ahithophel's counsel only",
            "They were divided and could not decide"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "They preferred Hushai's counsel over Ahithophel's",
          "explanation": "Absalom and the elders declared that Hushai's counsel was better than Ahithophel's, but this was according to the LORD’s will to frustrate Ahithophel's good counsel (2 Samuel 17:14). This highlights God's providential control over human decisions and the defeat of evil plans (Psalm 33:10-11, Proverbs 21:30, Isaiah 46:9-10, Acts 4:27-28).",

          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "They were priests who relayed Hushai's message to David",
            "They led the army against Absalom",
            "They counseled Absalom to follow Ahithophel's advice",
            "They betrayed David to Absalom"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "They were priests who relayed Hushai's message to David",
          "explanation": "Hushai communicated with Zadok and Abiathar, priests who helped send a warning to David to avoid danger, demonstrating the role of faithful spiritual leaders protecting God’s anointed (2 Samuel 17:15-16). This is consistent with the biblical role of priests and prophets as intercessors and messengers (Numbers 27:21, 1 Samuel 9:9, Hebrews 7:25, 1 Timothy 2:1-2).",

          "question": "What was the content of the message sent to David through Jonathan and Ahimaaz?",
          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "Do not lodge in the plains of the wilderness; pass quickly",

            "Hide in the city of Mahanaim"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Do not lodge in the plains of the wilderness; pass quickly",
          "explanation": "The message warned David not to stay in the wilderness plains that night but to cross the Jordan quickly to avoid capture, reflecting God's protection over His chosen king (2 Samuel 17:16, 21-22). This echoes God's care for His people in peril (Psalm 91:3-6, Isaiah 43:2, John 10:27-29, Romans 8:38-39).",

          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "He returned home and hanged himself",
            "He joined David's camp",

            "He fled to another country"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He returned home and hanged himself",
          "explanation": "Upon seeing that his advice was rejected, Ahithophel went home, arranged his affairs, and committed suicide (2 Samuel 17:23). This tragic end indicates the seriousness of rejecting wise counsel and the consequences of despair, contrasting with God's sustaining grace (Psalm 34:18, Proverbs 3:5-6, Matthew 11:28-30, 2 Corinthians 1:3-4).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Amasa",
          "explanation": "Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab (2 Samuel 17:25). This change in leadership reflects political maneuvering and human efforts to secure power, often opposed to God's anointed servants (1 Kings 2:5-6, Psalm 75:6-7, Proverbs 16:12, Acts 2:23).",

          ],

          "explanation": "Absalom and all the men of Israel camped in the land of Gilead (2 Samuel 17:26), a region east of the Jordan. This location is significant in biblical history as a place of refuge and conflict (Genesis 31:38, Judges 11:1, 2 Kings 15:29, Ezekiel 27:6).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Shobi, Machir, and Barzillai",
          "explanation": "Shobi son of Nahash, Machir son of Ammiel, and Barzillai the Gileadite brought food and supplies to David and his people, showing loyalty and support during David's hardship (2 Samuel 17:27-29). This kindness aligns with biblical themes of hospitality and support for God's servants (Ruth 2:14, 1 Kings 17:7-16, Acts 9:36-43, Hebrews 13:2).",

            "It demonstrates God's sovereignty over human plans",
            "It shows that God supports Absalom",

            "It indicates God's abandonment of David"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "It demonstrates God's sovereignty over human plans",
          "explanation": "The text explicitly states that the LORD appointed to defeat Ahithophel’s good counsel to bring evil upon Absalom (2 Samuel 17:14). This reveals God's ultimate control over events, ensuring His purposes prevail despite human intentions (Isaiah 46:9-11, Proverbs 19:21, Romans 8:28, Daniel 4:35).",

          "explanation": "Hushai’s imagery (2 Samuel 17:8) likens David’s men to a bear robbed of her cubs, emphasizing their intense protective fury and readiness to fight.
