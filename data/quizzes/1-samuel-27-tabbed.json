          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "He feared he would perish by Saul's hand",
            "He wanted to conquer the Philistines",
            "He sought to become king immediately",
            "He was commanded by God to go"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He feared he would perish by Saul's hand",
          "explanation": "David expressed his fear of perishing by Saul in 1 Samuel 27:1, choosing to escape to the Philistines. This reflects the human reality of fearing death (Psalm 23:4), yet God's providence in preserving His servants (Psalm 34:19). The New Testament also shows Jesus as the true King who overcame death (Hebrews 2:14).",

            "Sihon, king of the Amorites"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Achish, king of Gath",
          "explanation": "David and his men went to Achish, king of Gath (1 Samuel 27:2). This alliance shows the complexity of David's situation and God's sovereignty over political powers (Daniel 2:21). It also prefigures the Messianic king's interactions with Gentiles (Matthew 8:5-13).",

          "explanation": "David brought Ahinoam and Abigail with him to Gath (1 Samuel 27:3). This highlights the human dimension of David's life amidst political crisis, paralleling God's covenant faithfulness through family lines (Genesis 17:7). The New Testament upholds Jesus' fulfillment of the Davidic covenant (Luke 1:32-33).",

            "He sought no more for him",

            "He allied with David"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He sought no more for him",
          "explanation": "Saul ceased seeking David after learning he fled to Gath (1 Samuel 27:4), illustrating how human plans can be frustrated by God's providence (Proverbs 19:21). The New Testament also shows God's sovereignty over human rulers (Romans 13:1).",

            "To grant him a palace"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "To give him a town in the country",
          "explanation": "David asked Achish for a town in the country to dwell in, rather than the royal city (1 Samuel 27:5). This shows David's desire for separation despite his alliance, reflecting the tension believers face in a fallen world (John 17:14-16).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Ziklag",
          "explanation": "Achish gave David the town of Ziklag (1 Samuel 27:6). This town later figures into David's story as a place of refuge and restoration, symbolizing God's provision for His servant (Psalm 31:20).",

          "correctAnswer": "A full year and four months",
          "explanation": "David dwelt among the Philistines for a full year and four months (1 Samuel 27:7). This time demonstrates God's patience and the testing of His servant, paralleling other periods of trial (Genesis 37:2; Exodus 1:6).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "The Geshurites, the Gezrites, and the Amalekites",
          "explanation": "David raided the Geshurites, the Gezrites, and the Amalekites (1 Samuel 27:8). These groups were longstanding inhabitants of the land, underscoring the ongoing conflict between God's people and hostile nations (Exodus 17:8-16; Judges 6:3).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Left neither man nor woman alive",
          "explanation": "David left neither man nor woman alive in his raids (1 Samuel 27:9), indicating the severity of ancient warfare and judgment on nations. This reflects the Old Testament principle of divine judgment on evil (Deuteronomy 20:16-17), ultimately fulfilled in Christ's conquest over sin (Colossians 2:15).",

          "explanation": "David claimed his raids were against the south of Judah and neighboring peoples (1 Samuel 27:10). This deception shows human sinfulness (Romans 3:23) and the complexity of David's situation, yet God's ultimate plan for redemption.",

            "To recruit more men"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Lest they should tell Achish about his true activities",
          "explanation": "David spared no one to prevent them from reporting against him to Achish (1 Samuel 27:11). This illustrates the tension between human survival strategies and God's call to righteousness (Proverbs 10:9). Ultimately, Christ offers true deliverance from sin and deceit (John 8:36).",

          "correctAnswer": "Israel abhors David; he shall be Achish's servant forever",
          "explanation": "Achish believed Israel abhorred David and thus David would serve him forever (1 Samuel 27:12). This shows human misunderstanding of God's purposes. The New Testament reveals Jesus as the true servant-king, rejected yet exalted (Isaiah 53; Philippians 2:5-11).",

          "explanation": "David's flight to the Philistines demonstrates God's providential protection (1 Samuel 27:1-7). Though David faced danger, God preserved him. This aligns with biblical themes of God's sovereignty over trials (Psalm 46:1) and God's faithfulness to His promises (2 Timothy 2:13).",
