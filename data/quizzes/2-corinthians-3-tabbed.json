            "It was glorious but its glory was to be done away",

            "It was permanent and unchanging"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "It was glorious but its glory was to be done away",
          "explanation": "Verse 7 acknowledges the ministration of death (the Mosaic Law) was glorious, so much so that Moses' face shone, but that glory was temporary and to be done away. This correlates with Exodus 34:29-35, Hebrews 8:13, and Galatians 3:24-25, showing the temporary nature of the old covenant glory.",

          "correctAnswer": "The ministration of the Spirit is more glorious",
          "explanation": "Verse 8 contrasts the ministration of death with the ministration of the Spirit, stating the latter is more glorious. This highlights the superiority of gospel ministry over the Mosaic Law (Romans 8:2, John 16:13-14, Hebrews 7:22-25).",
