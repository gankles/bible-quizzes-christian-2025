Flood imagery is often used in Scripture to depict overwhelming forces (Genesis 7:17-18, Isaiah 59:19). The judgment on Egypt as a flood is parallel to God's control over the elements (Psalm 29:10) and His power to subdue nations (Revelation 17:15).",

This eschatological theme is consistent with other prophetic writings (Joel 2:31, Zephaniah 1:14-18, 1 Thessalonians 5:2) and the New Testament's teaching on Christ’s return as judge (2 Thessalonians 1:6-8).",
