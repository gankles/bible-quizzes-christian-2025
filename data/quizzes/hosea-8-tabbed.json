          "correctAnswer": "It was made by a workman",
          "explanation": "Hosea 8:6 clarifies that the calf is not God because it is a human-made idol, not divine. This aligns with Exodus 20:4-5 forbidding graven images, Isaiah 44:9-20 showing idols are man-made and powerless, and Psalm 115:4-8 confirming idols cannot save.",

          "correctAnswer": "Their Maker",
          "explanation": "Verse 14 states Israel forgot their Maker, causing them to build temples and walls in vain, provoking God's judgment by fire. This theme is central in Psalm 100:3, Isaiah 5:4, and Jeremiah 18:15 about forgetting God leading to destruction.",
