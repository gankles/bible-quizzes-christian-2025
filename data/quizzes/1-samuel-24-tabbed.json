          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "Respect for God's anointed and trust in divine judgment",

            "Desire for personal vengeance",
            "Lack of courage to kill Saul"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Respect for God's anointed and trust in divine judgment",
          "explanation": "David refrained from killing Saul because he recognized Saul as the LORD's anointed (1 Samuel 24:6). This respect for God's sovereign choice reflects the principle that vengeance belongs to God (Romans 12:19), and trust in God's righteous judgment is paramount (Psalm 37:6, Deuteronomy 32:35, Hebrews 10:30).",

          "options": [
            "Wickedness proceeds from the wicked, but my hand shall not be upon thee",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Wickedness proceeds from the wicked, but my hand shall not be upon thee",
          "explanation": "David states the proverb that wickedness comes from the wicked, but he refuses to act wickedly toward Saul (1 Samuel 24:13). This highlights the biblical truth that sin is the fruit of a corrupt heart (Jeremiah 17:9, James 1:14-15), yet believers are called to renounce vengeance (Romans 12:17-21).",

          "correctAnswer": "The piece of Saul's robe he cut off",
          "explanation": "David shows Saul the skirt of his robe that he had cut off without harming him, proving he had opportunity but chose not to sin against the LORD's anointed (1 Samuel 24:11). This act symbolizes restraint and integrity (Proverbs 3:3, Exodus 20:13, Matthew 5:44, Luke 6:27-28).",

          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "Because he felt it was wrong to harm the LORD's anointed",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Because he felt it was wrong to harm the LORD's anointed",
          "explanation": "David's conscience was troubled because he recognized Saul as God's anointed king, and harming him would be sin (1 Samuel 24:5-6). This reflects the biblical teaching on the conviction of sin (Psalm 51:4, Romans 2:15, 1 John 3:20).",

            "That Saul will give David a portion of the kingdom"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "That Saul will not cut off David's descendants nor destroy his name",
          "explanation": "David asks Saul to swear that he will not harm his descendants or erase his name, showing concern for covenantal mercy and legacy (1 Samuel 24:21). This reflects biblical emphasis on the blessing of posterity (Genesis 17:7, Psalm 112:2, 2 Samuel 7:12-16).",

            "David is a traitor to Israel"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "David is more righteous than he and has rewarded him good",
          "explanation": "Saul admits David's righteousness and kindness despite Saul's own evil toward David (1 Samuel 24:17-18). This recognition aligns with the biblical principle of honoring righteousness (Romans 12:17-21, Proverbs 21:15, Matthew 5:44).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "After a dead dog, after a flea",
          "explanation": "David uses this proverb to illustrate the futility and low regard Saul has for him (1 Samuel 24:14), emphasizing that God's protection over David renders Saul's pursuit ineffective. This imagery echoes biblical themes of God's protection over His servants (Psalm 23:4, Isaiah 54:17, Romans 8:31).",

          "correctAnswer": "God's sovereignty and mercy",
          "explanation": "God sovereignly allowed Saul to be vulnerable but showed mercy by restraining David from killing him (1 Samuel 24:10). This reveals God's control over human affairs and His merciful nature (Exodus 34:6, Psalm 145:8, Lamentations 3:22-23, Ephesians 2:4-5).",

          "correctAnswer": "Despite opportunity to sin, David restrains himself out of reverence for God’s anointed",
          "explanation": "David’s self-restraint despite having the chance to sin highlights human responsibility and reverence for God’s authority (1 Samuel 24:4-7).
