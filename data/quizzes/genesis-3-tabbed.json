          "explanation": "Genesis 3:3 includes the warning that they shall not eat or touch the tree lest they die, emphasizing the seriousness of disobedience. This death is both spiritual and physical, consistent with Romans 6:23 which teaches the wages of sin is death.",

          "explanation": "In Genesis 3:4, the serpent contradicts God's warning by saying 'Ye shall not surely die,' introducing doubt about God's word. This lie is foundational to the doctrine of sin as rebellion against God’s truth, echoed in John 8:44 where Satan is called the father of lies.",

          "explanation": "Genesis 3:5 states the serpent's promise that their eyes would be opened and they would be like gods, knowing good and evil.

          "explanation": "Genesis 3:6 explains the woman saw the fruit was good for food, pleasing to the eyes, and desirable for gaining wisdom, which motivated her to eat.
