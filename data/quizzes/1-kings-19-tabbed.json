          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "He fled to Beersheba and left his servant there",
            "He immediately confronted Jezebel",
            "He prayed for strength to fight",
            "He hid in the temple"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He fled to Beersheba and left his servant there",
          "explanation": "Elijah fled to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there as a response to Jezebel's threat, showing his fear and desire to escape (1 Kings 19:3). This illustrates human frailty under threat, consistent with Moses' flight in Exodus 2:15 and David's fleeing in 1 Samuel 19:10. Elijah's flight underscores the need for God's sustaining grace as later seen in Psalm 34:18 and Matthew 11:28.",

            "An angel gave him food and water twice",
            "He found manna on the ground",

            "He drank from a spring and ate wild berries"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "An angel gave him food and water twice",
          "explanation": "God sent an angel to touch Elijah and provide food and water twice, sustaining him for a 40-day journey (1 Kings 19:5-7). This echoes God's provision of manna for Israel in Exodus 16:4 and Elijah's earlier provision by ravens in 1 Kings 17:6. It illustrates God's care for the physical needs of His servants, reflected also in Psalm 104:14-15 and Jesus' teaching in Matthew 6:31-33.",

          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "He was despondent and wished to die, revealing human despair under pressure",

            "He was angry and planning revenge",
            "He was indifferent and apathetic"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He was despondent and wished to die, revealing human despair under pressure",
          "explanation": "Elijah requested for his life to be taken, saying 'It is enough,' showing deep despair and exhaustion (1 Kings 19:4). This reflects human vulnerability to discouragement, consistent with Jonah's similar despair in Jonah 4:3 and David's laments in Psalm 42:5. It highlights the need for God's comfort as promised in 2 Corinthians 1:3-4 and Jesus' invitation in Matthew 11:28.",

            "A fire"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "A still small voice",
          "explanation": "Elijah experienced God not in the wind, earthquake, or fire, but in a still small voice (1 Kings 19:11-12). This reveals God's transcendence and immanence, contrasting dramatic natural phenomena with intimate personal revelation. It parallels God's self-revelation to Moses in Exodus 3:2-4 and Jesus' teaching about the Spirit in John 14:26, emphasizing God's quiet, sovereign presence.",

          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "To anoint Hazael, Jehu, and Elisha for their respective roles",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "To anoint Hazael, Jehu, and Elisha for their respective roles",
          "explanation": "God instructed Elijah to anoint Hazael as king of Syria, Jehu as king of Israel, and Elisha as prophet in his place (1 Kings 19:15-16). This prophetic commissioning shows God's sovereign governance over nations and His plan for prophetic succession, consistent with the call of Samuel (1 Samuel 3:10), the anointing of David (1 Samuel 16:13), and Jesus' commissioning of the disciples (Matthew 28:18-20).",

          "question": "How did Elijah explain his sense of isolation in his prophetic mission?",
          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "He said he was the only one left who was faithful",
            "He claimed he was the most powerful prophet",
            "He said the people were all faithful",
            "He said he had many supporters among the prophets"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He said he was the only one left who was faithful",
          "explanation": "Elijah claimed that he alone was left faithful to the LORD because Israel had forsaken the covenant and killed the prophets (1 Kings 19:10,14). This feeling of isolation reflects the experience of faithful servants in Scripture, like Jeremiah (Jeremiah 15:17) and Paul (Romans 3:9-18). It underscores the reality of spiritual opposition and the need for God's reassurance (Isaiah 41:10, Hebrews 13:5).",

          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "God preserves a faithful remnant despite widespread apostasy",
            "No one remained faithful except Elijah",
            "All Israelites had abandoned the covenant",
            "The nation was entirely devoted to Baal worship"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "God preserves a faithful remnant despite widespread apostasy",
          "explanation": "God revealed that seven thousand remained in Israel who had not bowed to Baal or kissed him, illustrating His preservation of a faithful remnant (1 Kings 19:18). This theme of a remnant is central throughout Scripture, seen in Isaiah's promise of a remnant (Isaiah 10:20-22), Paul's teaching on remnant in Romans 11:5, and the preservation of the church in Revelation 12:17. It emphasizes God's covenant faithfulness and mercy.",

          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "He cast his mantle upon him",

            "He shared a meal with him"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He cast his mantle upon him",
          "explanation": "Elijah cast his mantle upon Elisha as a symbolic act of calling and transferring prophetic authority (1 Kings 19:19). This act signifies the passing of God's calling and is echoed in the New Testament where the laying on of hands signifies commissioning (2 Timothy 1:6). It also parallels the anointing of prophets and kings (1 Samuel 16:13) and the commissioning of disciples (Matthew 10:1).",

            "He requested to take over immediately"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He asked to bid farewell to his parents before following",
          "explanation": "Elisha requested to kiss his father and mother before following Elijah, demonstrating respect for family and proper closure before ministry (1 Kings 19:20). Elijah's response, 'Go back again,' indicates a test of commitment. This interaction reflects biblical balance between family responsibilities and divine call, as seen in Jesus' teaching in Luke 14:26-27 and Paul's instructions in 1 Timothy 5:8.",

            "He slaughtered his oxen and used the equipment to prepare a meal for the people",

            "He sent a message to Elijah"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He slaughtered his oxen and used the equipment to prepare a meal for the people",
          "explanation": "Elisha slaughtered his oxen, boiled their flesh with the instruments, and gave it to the people to eat before fully committing to follow Elijah (1 Kings 19:21). This act symbolizes renouncing his old life and dedicating himself to God's work, similar to Jesus' call to discipleship in Luke 9:62 and Paul's call to leave old customs in Romans 6:6.",

            "God’s presence is often revealed in quietness rather than spectacle",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "God’s presence is often revealed in quietness rather than spectacle",
          "explanation": "Elijah's encounter shows that God's presence and guidance can come through gentle, quiet means rather than dramatic events (1 Kings 19:11-12). This aligns with Jesus’ teaching about the Spirit's subtle work (John 3:8), God speaking to Samuel softly (1 Samuel 3:10), and the peace God provides in Philippians 4:7. It challenges views that God must always act visibly or powerfully.",

          "correctAnswer": "God sustains and guides His servants even in times of weakness and fear",
          "explanation": "Elijah’s journey, provision by an angel, and encounter with God demonstrate God’s providential care even when Elijah is fearful and discouraged (1 Kings 19:4-8). This is consistent with God's providence over Israel (Psalm 23:1-4), Jesus' teaching on God caring for sparrows (Matthew 10:29-31), and Paul’s trust in God’s guidance (Romans 8:28). It affirms that God works through human weakness.",

          "correctAnswer": "God exercises sovereign control over nations and appoints leaders",
          "explanation": "God’s command to Elijah to anoint Hazael, Jehu, and Elisha shows that God ordains rulers and prophets to fulfill His purposes (1 Kings 19:15-16). This theme resonates with God’s sovereignty in appointing Cyrus (Isaiah 45:1), David (Acts 13:22), and the ultimate reign of Christ (Revelation 19:16). It assures believers of God's control over history (Daniel 2:21).",

          "explanation": "Elijah states that Israel forsook God's covenant, threw down altars, and killed prophets (1 Kings 19:10,14), highlighting covenant unfaithfulness and sin. This reflects the covenant curses in Deuteronomy 28 and the prophetic call to repentance in Jeremiah 2:13. The New Testament parallels include warnings against apostasy (Hebrews 3:12) and the call to faithfulness (Revelation 2:5).",

This is comparable to Moses veiling his face after seeing God’s glory (Exodus 34:33-35) and the biblical motif of hiding one’s face in God's presence (Isaiah 6:5). It expresses humility and readiness for divine encounter.",
