          "question": "What reason did David give Ahimelech the priest for coming alone and without his men?",
          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said let no man know",
            "I was sent alone by Saul to test your loyalty",
            "I have been rejected by my men",
            "I came secretly to avoid enemies"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said let no man know",
          "explanation": "David explained to Ahimelech that the king had given him a secret mission and instructed him to come alone (1 Samuel 21:2). This shows David’s obedience and the secretive nature of his mission. This aligns with biblical themes of obedience to authority (Romans 13:1-2), God’s providence in hiding plans (Psalm 31:20), and the necessity of faith in God’s direction (Proverbs 3:5-6).",

            "Unleavened bread"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Hallowed bread",
          "explanation": "Ahimelech gave David hallowed bread, the consecrated bread normally reserved for priests (1 Samuel 21:6). This act foreshadows Christ as the Bread of Life (John 6:35) and reveals God's provision through sacred objects. It also reflects the holiness required before God (Leviticus 10:10) and Jesus’ teaching on mercy over ritual (Matthew 12:3-4).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "The young men must have kept themselves from women",
          "explanation": "Ahimelech specified that the bread could only be given if the young men had kept themselves from women, reflecting the Old Testament purity laws (1 Samuel 21:4). This highlights the holiness required to partake in sacred things (Leviticus 15:18), the principle of sanctification (1 Corinthians 6:18-20), and the importance of purity before God (Hebrews 12:14).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "The sword of Goliath, symbolizing David’s victory over the Philistine",
          "explanation": "Ahimelech offered David the sword of Goliath, which he had slain, symbolizing God's deliverance and David’s role as a divinely empowered warrior (1 Samuel 21:9). This foreshadows Christ’s victory over evil (Colossians 2:15), God’s empowerment of His servants (Ephesians 6:17), and the triumph of faith over worldly powers (Revelation 12:11).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Because the king's business required haste",
          "explanation": "David told Ahimelech he did not bring weapons because the king's business was urgent and required haste (1 Samuel 21:8). This illustrates God's providential timing (Ecclesiastes 3:1), the urgency of obedience (Luke 9:59-60), and reliance on God’s protection rather than human strength (Psalm 20:7).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "An Edomite servant of Saul present during David's visit to Ahimelech",
          "explanation": "Doeg was an Edomite servant of Saul and the chief of his herdmen, present when David met Ahimelech (1 Samuel 21:7). His presence highlights human sinfulness and betrayal (Psalm 41:9), the danger of disloyalty (2 Samuel 16:20-23), and the consequences of fear leading to violence (Proverbs 29:25).",

          "correctAnswer": "King Achish of Gath, due to fear of Saul",
          "explanation": "David fled to Achish, king of Gath, because he feared Saul’s pursuit (1 Samuel 21:10). This reflects the theme of divine protection amidst trials (Psalm 34:17-19), the testing of faith (James 1:2-4), and the paradox of seeking refuge among enemies (Psalm 18:2).",

          "explanation": "Achish’s servants identified David as a celebrated warrior, noting his greater success than Saul (1 Samuel 21:11). This shows the recognition of God’s empowerment (Exodus 17:11-13), the role of God’s anointed leader (Psalm 2:2-4), and the tension between human praise and divine sovereignty (John 7:18).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He was sore afraid and changed his behavior, feigning madness",
          "explanation": "David feigned madness to avoid harm, showing human vulnerability and reliance on God’s providence (1 Samuel 21:12-13). This act reveals the tension between human fear and divine trust (Psalm 56:3-4), the wisdom in certain deceptions for survival (Ecclesiastes 3:7), and God’s protection over His servant (Psalm 91:4).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let his spittle fall on his beard",
          "explanation": "David’s behavior included scratching the doors and letting his saliva fall on his beard (1 Samuel 21:13), actions meant to convince others he was mad. This illustrates the human instinct for self-preservation (Proverbs 22:3), the use of wisdom in adversity (Matthew 10:16), and God’s sovereignty over even desperate actions (Romans 8:28).",
