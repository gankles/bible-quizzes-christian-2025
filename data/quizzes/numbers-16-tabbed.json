            "Phinehas and Eleazar"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Korah, Dathan, and Abiram",
          "explanation": "Korah, along with Dathan and Abiram, led the rebellion against Moses and Aaron, claiming that all Israelites were holy and questioning their authority (Numbers 16:1-3). This challenge to divinely appointed leadership is consistent with the biblical theme of rebellion against God's chosen servants (e.g., 1 Samuel 15:23; Jude 1:9).",

            "He called for the people to stone them"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He fell upon his face",
          "explanation": "Upon hearing the rebellion, Moses fell upon his face in humility and intercession (Numbers 16:4). This reflects the biblical pattern of intercessory prayer in the face of sin (Exodus 32:11-14; Hebrews 7:25).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Offer incense on censers before the LORD",
          "explanation": "God instructed that Korah and his company take censers with fire and incense and present them before the LORD to see who He had chosen (Numbers 16:6-7). The use of incense symbolizes priestly intercession and divine acceptance (Exodus 30:7-8; Revelation 8:3-4).",

          "type": "multiple-choice",

            "To receive double portions of the land"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "To serve the tabernacle and minister before the congregation",
          "explanation": "Moses reminded them that God had set the Levites apart to serve the tabernacle and minister before the congregation (Numbers 16:9-10). This highlights God's sovereign appointment of roles within the covenant community (Deuteronomy 10:8; Hebrews 7:26).",

            "They sought mediation through the elders"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "They refused to come and accused Moses of killing them",
          "explanation": "Dathan and Abiram refused to come when called and accused Moses of bringing them out of a land flowing with milk and honey only to kill them in the wilderness (Numbers 16:12-14). This illustrates human rebellion against divine providence and leadership (Psalm 78:17-22; Acts 7:51).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "If the earth opened and swallowed the rebels alive",
          "explanation": "Moses declared that if the rebels died a common death, he was not sent by the LORD; but if the earth opened and swallowed them alive, it would confirm God's judgment and Moses’ divine commission (Numbers 16:28-30). This miraculous judgment underscores God's holiness and justice (Psalm 94:23; Hebrews 12:29).",

          "explanation": "After Moses finished speaking, the earth split apart and swallowed the rebels and their households alive, and the earth closed over them, demonstrating God's immediate and decisive judgment against rebellion (Numbers 16:31-33). This typifies divine judgment against sin (Deuteronomy 11:6; Jude 1:7).",
