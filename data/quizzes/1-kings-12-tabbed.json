          "correctAnswer": "Make the yoke lighter than Solomon's",
          "explanation": "The people asked Rehoboam to lighten the heavy yoke that Solomon had put upon them, as stated in 1 Kings 12:4. This reflects their burden under Solomon's reign. Similar appeals for mercy and lighter burdens are found in Exodus 1:11-14 where the Israelites were oppressed, and in Matthew 11:28-30 where Jesus invites the weary to find rest.",

          "explanation": "Rehoboam rejected the wise counsel of the old men who advised him to be a servant to the people and speak good words (1 Kings 12:8). This rejection led to harsh leadership. The failure to heed wise counsel is a recurring biblical theme (Proverbs 1:7, Proverbs 19:20) and contrasts with Christ who perfectly obeyed the Father’s will (Hebrews 5:8).",

          "correctAnswer": "To increase the harshness and add to their yoke",
          "explanation": "The young men advised Rehoboam to speak harshly, saying his little finger would be thicker than his father's loins and he would chastise with scorpions instead of whips (1 Kings 12:10-11). This reflects human pride and hardness of heart, opposing God’s call to humility (James 4:6, Proverbs 16:18).",

          "correctAnswer": "The people rebelled and the kingdom split",
          "explanation": "After Rehoboam's harsh response, all Israel rejected him, saying, 'What portion have we in David?' and the kingdom was divided (1 Kings 12:16, 19). This division fulfilled God’s judgment and highlights human sinfulness and the consequences of pride (Romans 3:23, Judges 21:25).",

          "correctAnswer": "Jeroboam",
          "explanation": "The people of Israel made Jeroboam king over all Israel except Judah (1 Kings 12:20). This illustrates God's providential sovereignty in raising leaders and the unfolding of His redemptive plan despite human rebellion (Acts 17:26, Romans 13:1).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Do not fight your brethren, return to your houses",
          "explanation": "God, through the prophet Shemaiah, commanded Rehoboam and his army not to fight Israel but to return home, showing God's sovereign control over divisions and conflicts (1 Kings 12:22-24). This reflects God's desire for peace among His people and foreshadows the peace brought by Christ (Matthew 5:9, Romans 12:18).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "To prevent the people from returning to Jerusalem to worship",
          "explanation": "Jeroboam feared that if the people went to Jerusalem to sacrifice, their hearts would return to Rehoboam, so he made two golden calves to redirect worship and secure his reign (1 Kings 12:26-28). This act became a sin, showing the dangers of idolatry and false worship (Exodus 32, Hosea 8:5-6).",

          "correctAnswer": "Bethel and Dan",
          "explanation": "Jeroboam set one calf in Bethel and the other in Dan as centers for idol worship (1 Kings 12:29). This highlights the departure from true worship and the creation of syncretistic religious practices condemned throughout Scripture (Deuteronomy 12:29-32, Isaiah 44:9-20).",

            "He forbade priests from offering sacrifices"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He made priests from the lowest of the people, not from the Levites",
          "explanation": "Jeroboam appointed non-Levitical priests, violating God's ordinance that priests come from Levi (1 Kings 12:31). This showed disregard for God's established order and contributed to Israel’s spiritual decline (Numbers 3:10, Malachi 2:7).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "A feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month",
          "explanation": "Jeroboam established a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, imitating but not following the true feasts of the LORD (1 Kings 12:32-33). This reflects human innovation in worship apart from God's instructions, akin to false worship condemned in Jeremiah 7:21-23.",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "To keep the people from returning to Jerusalem and to secure his kingship",
          "explanation": "Jeroboam’s motivation was political—to prevent the hearts of the people from returning to Rehoboam by redirecting worship to local shrines (1 Kings 12:26-27). This illustrates the danger of mixing politics with religion and creating idolatry (2 Chronicles 11:15; Colossians 2:8).",

          "explanation": "God allowed Rehoboam’s harshness to fulfill the prophecy spoken by Ahijah regarding Jeroboam’s rise (1 Kings 12:15). This demonstrates God’s sovereignty in using human sin to accomplish divine purposes (Isaiah 10:5-7, Romans 8:28).",

          "correctAnswer": "He was stoned to death by Israel",
          "explanation": "Adoram was stoned to death by the Israelites when sent to collect tribute (1 Kings 12:18). This violent rejection of Rehoboam's rule reflects the depth of the people's rebellion and the consequences of unjust leadership (Ecclesiastes 5:8-9, Proverbs 29:2).",

          "correctAnswer": "Judah and Benjamin",
          "explanation": "After the division, only Judah and Benjamin remained loyal to Rehoboam (1 Kings 12:21). This reflects the tribal divisions and God's covenantal faithfulness to David’s line, ultimately fulfilled in Christ, the descendant of Judah (Genesis 49:10, Luke 3:33).",
