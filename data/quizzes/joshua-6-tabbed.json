          "explanation": "God commanded Joshua and Israel to march around Jericho once for six days, and on the seventh day, to march around it seven times (Joshua 6:3-4,14-15).

          "explanation": "Seven priests bore seven trumpets of rams' horns and blew them as they circled the city with the ark of the covenant (Joshua 6:4,6-9). This priestly role highlights God's presence (ark of the covenant) and the spiritual warfare dimension, consistent with priestly intercession and worship in the Old Testament (Leviticus 25:9) and the New Testament priesthood of believers (Hebrews 4:14-16).",
