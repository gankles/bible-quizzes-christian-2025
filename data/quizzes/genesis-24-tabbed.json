          ],
          "correctAnswer": "That the wife be from Abraham's country and kindred",
          "explanation": "Abraham explicitly commands his servant not to take a wife for Isaac from the Canaanites but from his own country and kindred (Genesis 24:3-4). This shows the importance of covenantal lineage and separation from surrounding peoples. This accords with Deuteronomy 7:3-4, which forbids intermarriage with certain nations to preserve holiness. The New Testament affirms God's faithfulness to his promises to Abraham's seed (Galatians 3:16), and the necessity of godly heritage in spiritual lineage (2 Timothy 2:2).",

          "explanation": "Abraham asked his servant to put his hand under his thigh to swear an oath (Genesis 24:2-9). This act symbolized a serious covenantal oath related to the continuation of Abraham’s lineage, similar to other covenantal acts like circumcision (Genesis 17:9-14).
