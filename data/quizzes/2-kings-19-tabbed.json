          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He rents his clothes and prays to the LORD",
          "explanation": "Hezekiah's response of humility and prayer, tearing his clothes and covering himself with sackcloth, reflects repentance and trust in God (2 Kings 19:1). This aligns with biblical calls to seek God in times of distress (Psalm 34:18; Joel 2:12; Daniel 9:3; James 5:16).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Eliakim, Shebna, and the elders of the priests",
          "explanation": "Hezekiah sends key officials and priests, showing the importance of seeking divine guidance through God’s appointed prophet (2 Kings 19:2). This practice is consistent with seeking prophetic counsel in times of crisis (1 Samuel 9:9; Jeremiah 1:7; Acts 11:27-28; Hebrews 1:1).",

          "explanation": "The servants describe the current crisis as severe, marked by divine rebuke and blasphemy, highlighting human sin and opposition to God’s sovereignty (2 Kings 19:3). This reflects the biblical theme of judgment and the consequences of sin (Isaiah 59:1-2; Romans 1:18; Hebrews 12:6; Revelation 3:19).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Be not afraid and lift up your prayer for the remnant",
          "explanation": "Isaiah urges trust in God rather than fear, emphasizing prayer for those who remain faithful, demonstrating God's faithfulness and protection of His people (2 Kings 19:6,4). This echoes biblical calls to trust God in adversity (Psalm 46:1-3; Isaiah 41:10; Philippians 4:6-7; 1 Peter 5:7).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He will send a blast causing him to hear a rumor and return to his land",
          "explanation": "God promises to intervene supernaturally to thwart Assyria’s plans, demonstrating His sovereign control over history (2 Kings 19:7). This divine protection is consistent with God’s deliverance of His people in other biblical events (Exodus 14:21-22; Psalm 91:7; Daniel 6:22; Acts 12:7).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "That God will not deliver Jerusalem from Assyria",
          "explanation": "The Assyrian king mocks Hezekiah’s trust, denying God’s power to save (2 Kings 19:10), which represents a common challenge against divine sovereignty and salvation (Psalm 2:1-4; Isaiah 44:6-8; John 3:18; Romans 9:20-21).",

            "He hides the letter from the people"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He spreads the letter before the LORD and prays",
          "explanation": "Hezekiah’s act of presenting the letter before God signifies complete dependence on divine intervention (2 Kings 19:14-15). This reflects biblical examples of bringing burdens to God in prayer (Psalm 25:1-2; 1 Kings 8:54-55; Philippians 4:6; Hebrews 4:16).",
