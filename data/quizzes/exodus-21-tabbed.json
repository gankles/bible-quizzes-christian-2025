          "correctAnswer": "Six years of service, free in the seventh",
          "explanation": "Exodus 21:2 commands that a Hebrew servant serve for six years and be free in the seventh. This highlights God's provision for restoration and freedom, similar to the sabbatical year principle in Leviticus 25:40, and reflects the principle of liberty and redemption also seen in Galatians 5:1 and the servant's release in Jeremiah 34:14.",
