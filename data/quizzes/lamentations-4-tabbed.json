          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Their tongues cleave to the roof of their mouths for thirst",
          "explanation": "Lamentations 4:4 depicts children suffering extreme thirst and hunger, symbolizing the devastating effects of siege and famine. This echoes the dire conditions in 2 Kings 6:25 and reveals God's judgment manifesting in human suffering. The New Testament calls believers to care for the vulnerable (Matthew 25:35-40), contrasting with the neglect shown here.",

          "explanation": "Lamentations 4:6 highlights that Zion's punishment exceeds that of Sodom, emphasizing the gravity of her sins. This teaches about God's justice and holiness, comparing with Genesis 19 where Sodom was destroyed swiftly. It reflects the principle that greater revelation brings greater accountability (Luke 12:48). God's judgment is righteous and proportionate to sin.",

The imagery of purity aligns with biblical holiness (Psalm 51:7) and the call to be sanctified (1 Peter 1:16).",
