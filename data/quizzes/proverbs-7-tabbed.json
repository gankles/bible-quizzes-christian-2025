This aligns with biblical warnings against seductive speech and deceit (Psalm 5:9, Colossians 2:8). James 3:6 warns that the tongue can set a person on fire, and 2 Timothy 3:13 warns of those who use smooth talk to deceive.",

          "correctAnswer": "It is of utmost importance and value",
          "explanation": "Proverbs 7:2 describes the law as the 'apple of thine eye,' an expression denoting something precious and carefully protected. Deuteronomy 32:10 and Zechariah 2:8 use similar imagery for God's care. Jesus references this in Matthew 6:22-23 emphasizing the eye as the lamp of the body, linking spiritual focus to life.

          "explanation": "Proverbs 7:27 warns that the adulterous woman's house leads to hell and the chambers of death, symbolizing eternal judgment and destruction. This is consistent with Proverbs 5:5, 9:18 and the New Testament's warnings about sin leading to death (Romans 6:23). Jesus speaks of hell (Gehenna) as the ultimate destination for sin (Matthew 10:28). Hebrews 10:26-27 also warns of judgment for deliberate sin.",

This illustrates human susceptibility to temptation and aligns with James 1:14-15 about desire leading to sin and death. Romans 7:15-20 also describes the internal struggle with sin.",

This echoes Isaiah 53:7 where the suffering servant is led like a lamb to the slaughter. 1 Corinthians 15:32 contrasts death's victory, and Hebrews 12:1-2 urges believers to run with purpose, unlike the naive man here.",

This parallels Deuteronomy 6:6-8 which commands God's word to be on the heart and hands. Psalm 119:11 expresses hiding God's word in the heart to avoid sin, and Colossians 3:16 encourages letting the word dwell richly within.",

          "correctAnswer": "She has peace offerings and has paid her vows",
          "explanation": "Proverbs 7:14 shows the woman claiming to have peace offerings and that she has paid her vows to justify her being out. This is deceptive, masking sin with religious language. This echoes warnings in Isaiah 1:11-17 about meaningless offerings without repentance, and Jesus’ critique of hypocritical worship in Matthew 15:7-9. Hebrews 10:22 calls for sincere hearts, not empty rituals.",

          "explanation": "Proverbs 7:19-20 states the 'goodman' is away on a long journey with money, implying opportunity for the woman’s illicit actions. This highlights how sin exploits absence and vulnerability, similar to the temptation of David and Bathsheba in 2 Samuel 11. Galatians 6:7 warns that sowing to the flesh leads to ruin, and Proverbs 21:25-26 show the danger of neglecting duty.",

This aligns with the New Testament warnings about the devil prowling like a roaring lion seeking to devour (1 Peter 5:8). Proverbs 6:26 also warns about the adulterous woman seeking victims.",
