          "explanation": "Psalms 75:3 declares the earth and its inhabitants dissolve, yet God upholds the pillars, demonstrating His sustaining power over creation. This parallels Hebrews 1:3, where Christ upholds all things by His word. Isaiah 40:8 contrasts the fading earth with God's word, and Colossians 1:17 affirms Christ's sustaining role.

          "explanation": "Psalms 75:4 warns fools and wicked not to act foolishly or arrogantly ('lift up the horn'). This horn symbolizes pride and power, echoed in Proverbs 16:18 about pride leading to destruction. Isaiah 10:12 shows God humbling the arrogant, and James 4:6 states God opposes the proud. 1 Peter 5:5 encourages humility before God’s exaltation.",

          "correctAnswer": "Promotion comes only from God, not from east, west, or south",
          "explanation": "Psalms 75:6 emphasizes promotion does not come from any earthly direction but solely from God. This teaches God’s sovereign control over human affairs. Daniel 2:21 affirms God sets up and removes kings. Proverbs 21:1 describes God directing rulers’ hearts. James 4:10 calls believers to humble themselves before God who will exalt them, and 1 Samuel 2:7 declares God raises the poor and brings down the proud.",

          "correctAnswer": "God is the judge who puts down one and sets up another",
          "explanation": "Psalms 75:7 states God as judge acts decisively in elevating or humbling individuals. This reflects themes in 1 Samuel 2:6-7, where God raises and casts down. Proverbs 3:34 says God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. Luke 1:52 speaks of God bringing down the mighty and exalting the lowly.

This metaphor parallels Revelation 14:10 and 16:19 where God's wrath is depicted as a cup of wine. Jeremiah 25:15-16 also uses the cup imagery for divine wrath. Isaiah 51:17 speaks of the cup of God's fury. The New Testament uses the cup symbolically in Matthew 26:39 regarding suffering but here it denotes judgment.",

          "explanation": "Psalms 75:10 contrasts the fate of the wicked and righteous using the imagery of horns symbolizing strength and power. The wicked's power will be removed, while the righteous will be exalted. This theme appears in 1 Samuel 2:1-10, where God lifts the humble and casts down the wicked. Luke 1:52 echoes God scattering the proud and exalting the humble. Proverbs 10:27 associates fear of the Lord with life, and Revelation 5:5 refers to Christ as the Lion, a horn of salvation.",

David is the author of many Psalms but not this one. Solomon and Moses wrote other biblical songs or Psalms but are not attributed here. 1 Chronicles 16:7-36 references Asaph’s role in worship and Psalm authorship.",

          "correctAnswer": "Do not be stubborn or rebellious",
          "explanation": "The phrase 'speak not with a stiff neck' in Psalms 75:5 metaphorically calls for humility and warns against stubbornness or rebellion against God’s authority. This imagery appears in Exodus 32:9-10, where Israel is described as stiff-necked. Proverbs 29:1 links stubbornness to punishment. Jeremiah 7:26 and Acts 7:51 use similar language to describe resistance to God’s word. The New Testament encourages humble submission (James 4:7).",

This is consistent with Genesis 28:13-15 where God promises to bless Jacob’s descendants. Psalm 89:28 speaks of God's covenant forever. Hebrews 6:13-18 affirms God's unchanging purpose, and Revelation 5:13 describes unending worship of God. This illustrates the doctrine of God's faithfulness and covenantal grace.",

This aligns with Revelation 14:10 and Jeremiah 25:15 where God's wrath is depicted as a cup of wine. The mixed wine suggests severity and fullness of wrath. Isaiah 51:17 also uses this imagery.
