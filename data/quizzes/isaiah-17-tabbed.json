          "explanation": "Isaiah 17:5 uses the metaphor of a harvestman gathering and reaping ears of corn to symbolize thorough devastation and removal of sustenance. This agricultural imagery conveys judgment and loss, similar to Joel 1:10-12 where harvest is described as destroyed, and Jeremiah 12:10 where vineyards are laid waste. It points to consequences of sin and God's judgment (Romans 6:23).",

This reflects repentance and faith, consistent with Acts 17:27 where God is sought by all, and Psalm 46:10 urging to know God as sovereign.

This shows human reliance on worldly means rather than divine provision, similar to Hosea 2:8 and Jeremiah 2:13 where forsaking God leads to futility.
