          "explanation": "David explicitly states in 1 Samuel 26:9 that he will not harm Saul because Saul is the LORD's anointed, and stretching out a hand against the LORD's anointed would bring guilt.

          "explanation": "David rebukes Abner for not guarding Saul, saying it is not good and they are worthy to die for not keeping their master, the LORD's anointed (1 Samuel 26:15-16). This emphasizes the sacred duty to protect God's appointed leaders, reflecting the biblical principle of stewardship (Romans 13:4).",

          "explanation": "David likens Saul’s pursuit to hunting a flea or a partridge (1 Samuel 26:20), illustrating the futility and triviality of Saul’s efforts against him. This metaphor reflects the biblical theme of God’s protection over the righteous (Psalm 91:1-4, Isaiah 40:11).",
