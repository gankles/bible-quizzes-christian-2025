          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "Because of Saul and his bloody house for slaying the Gibeonites",

            "Because the Philistines were attacking Israel",
            "Because the land was cursed for idol worship"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Because of Saul and his bloody house for slaying the Gibeonites",
          "explanation": "The famine was due to the bloodguilt of Saul's house because he slew the Gibeonites, as God revealed to David (2 Samuel 21:1). This reflects God's justice and the consequences of covenant violation (Numbers 35:33, Joshua 9:14, 2 Samuel 21:1, Ezekiel 18:20, Hebrews 12:6).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Remnant of the Amorites, not Israelites",
          "explanation": "The Gibeonites were a remnant of the Amorites and not Israelites, but Israel had sworn to spare them (2 Samuel 21:2). This shows God's commitment to His covenant promises even with non-Israelites (Joshua 9:15, Romans 9:25, Matthew 5:37, Hebrews 6:13-17, Genesis 12:3).",

          "correctAnswer": "Silver and gold",
          "explanation": "The Gibeonites rejected silver and gold from Saul's house as compensation and instead requested the death of certain descendants to make atonement (2 Samuel 21:4). This highlights the seriousness of blood guilt and the need for just reparation, consistent with Old Testament law (Exodus 21:23-25, Leviticus 17:11, Numbers 35:30, Jeremiah 31:29, Hebrews 9:22).",

          "explanation": "The Gibeonites asked for seven men of Saul's sons to be handed over to be hanged as a form of atonement (2 Samuel 21:6). The number seven often symbolizes completeness in biblical justice (Genesis 4:15, Leviticus 4:6, Numbers 29:12, Revelation 1:20, Hebrews 11:4).",

          "options": [
            "Because of the LORD's oath between David and Jonathan",
            "Because Mephibosheth was too young",

          ],

          "explanation": "David spared Mephibosheth due to the covenant oath he made with Jonathan, showing the importance of faithfulness to God's promises and covenant loyalty (2 Samuel 21:7).

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "She guarded their bodies from scavengers until the rains came",
          "explanation": "Rizpah spread sackcloth on a rock and protected the bodies of the executed sons from birds and beasts until rain fell, demonstrating profound grief and respect for the dead (2 Samuel 21:10). This act reflects the ancient Near Eastern concept of honoring the dead and the biblical emphasis on mourning (Genesis 37:35, 2 Samuel 3:35, Ezekiel 37:1-14, Luke 7:13, Romans 12:15).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He retrieved the bones of Saul, Jonathan, and those executed for proper burial",
          "explanation": "David honored the dead by retrieving and properly burying the bones of Saul, Jonathan, and the executed sons, an act that brought God's favor upon the land (2 Samuel 21:11-14). Proper burial is a biblical duty showing respect for the body and God's design for death and resurrection (Genesis 50:25, 1 Kings 2:6, John 11:44, 1 Corinthians 15:42, Revelation 20:13).",

          "explanation": "After David fulfilled the burial rites, God was entreated for the land, implying the famine ended, showing God's mercy upon repentance and obedience (2 Samuel 21:14). This illustrates God's covenantal responsiveness (2 Chronicles 7:14, Joel 2:13, Jonah 3:10, Psalm 85:6, James 4:8).",

          "explanation": "Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Saph, a giant's son, at Gob, indicating that God's people, empowered by Him, can overcome formidable enemies (2 Samuel 21:18). This aligns with God's promise to give victory over giants (Joshua 1:6-9, 1 Samuel 17:50, Psalm 18:39, Ephesians 6:10-11, Romans 8:37).",

          "explanation": "Elhanan, a Bethlehemite, killed Goliath's brother, showing that multiple servants of God played roles in defeating the enemies of Israel (2 Samuel 21:19).
