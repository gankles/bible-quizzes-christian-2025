          "question": "What aspect of Jephthah's background caused his half-brothers to reject him and deny him inheritance?",
          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "He was the son of a harlot",
            "He was physically weak",

            "He worshipped other gods"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He was the son of a harlot",
          "explanation": "Jephthah was rejected by his brothers because he was the son of a harlot, which they used to disinherit him (Judges 11:1-2). This illustrates the biblical theme of human rejection despite God's calling, as also seen in Moses' exile (Exodus 2:11-15) and David's humble beginnings (1 Samuel 16:1-13). Yet God often raises the rejected for His purposes (1 Corinthians 1:27-29).",

          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "Because they needed a mighty warrior to lead them",
            "Because Jephthah was the rightful king",
            "Because Jephthah was the only surviving son",
            "Because Jephthah had diplomatic skills"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Because they needed a mighty warrior to lead them",
          "explanation": "The elders sought Jephthah because they recognized his valor and capability to lead in battle against Ammon (Judges 11:5-6). This reflects God's sovereign use of unlikely leaders (Judges 6:12; 1 Samuel 17:32-50) and the biblical principle that God equips the called for His mission (Ephesians 6:10-18).",

          "options": [
            "That the LORD deliver the Ammonites into his hands",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "That the LORD deliver the Ammonites into his hands",
          "explanation": "Jephthah stipulated that if God granted him victory over the Ammonites, then he would become their leader (Judges 11:9-10). This underscores the doctrine of divine sovereignty in salvation and deliverance (Psalm 20:7; Romans 8:31), emphasizing trust in God's providential power rather than human strength.",

            "By recounting Israel's peaceful request to pass through Edom and Moab",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "By recounting Israel's peaceful request to pass through Edom and Moab",
          "explanation": "Jephthah argued that Israel never took land from Moab or Ammon but only from Amorites after peaceful passage was denied (Judges 11:16-18). This defense reflects the biblical principle of just war and God's providential granting of the land (Deuteronomy 2:1-8; Psalm 24:1), affirming God's role as the ultimate judge and disposer of nations.",

          "type": "multiple-choice",

            "That each god grants territory to their people and that Israel's God has dispossessed the Amorites",
            "That all gods are equal in power",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "That each god grants territory to their people and that Israel's God has dispossessed the Amorites",
          "explanation": "Jephthah acknowledged that Chemosh gave Moab their land, but argued that the LORD had dispossessed the Amorites for Israel (Judges 11:23-24). This reveals the biblical understanding of God's sovereign judgment over nations (Psalm 2:8-9; Isaiah 45:1) and the Lord as the ultimate possessor of the earth (Psalm 24:1).",

          "explanation": "Jephthah vowed that if the LORD gave him victory, he would dedicate whatever first came out of his house to greet him as a burnt offering (Judges 11:30-31). This tragic vow highlights the seriousness of vows to God (Ecclesiastes 5:4-5) and the dangers of rash promises, contrasting with Christ's perfect and sufficient sacrifice (Hebrews 10:10).",

          "explanation": "The Spirit of the LORD came on Jephthah, enabling his leadership and military success (Judges 11:29).

          "explanation": "Jephthah's only daughter came out dancing to meet him, and due to his vow, he was grieved because he could not revoke it (Judges 11:34-35). This episode illustrates the consequences of rash vows (Ecclesiastes 5:2-6) and the cost of human sinfulness, foreshadowing the need for Christ's perfect atonement (Hebrews 7:27).",

          "explanation": "Jephthah's experience shows the gravity of making vows to God and the serious consequences if not carefully considered (Judges 11:30-39). Scripture elsewhere commands fulfilling vows (Numbers 30:2) but condemns human sacrifice (Leviticus 18:21), pointing ultimately to Christ's perfect sacrifice as the true fulfillment (Hebrews 10:5-10).",

          "explanation": "Jephthah, despite his illegitimate birth and flaws, was used by God to deliver Israel (Judges 11:1-11).
