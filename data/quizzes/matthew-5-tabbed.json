          "explanation": "Matthew 5:29 states 'if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee.' This hyperbolic teaching emphasizes the severity of sin and the necessity of radical action to avoid it, consistent with Paul's teaching in 1 Corinthians 6:18 to flee immorality, and Job 31:1 about guarding the eyes. It underscores the call to holiness.",

Jesus affirms the continuing validity and fulfillment of the Old Testament Law and Prophets, consistent with Luke 24:44 and Romans 10:4.

          "explanation": "Matthew 5:44 commands to 'Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.' This radical love reflects God's character (Matthew 5:45), loving both evil and good. Romans 12:20, Luke 6:27-28, and 1 Peter 3:9 reinforce loving and blessing enemies rather than retaliating.",

          "explanation": "Matthew 5:13 states 'if the salt have lost his savour... it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.' Salt symbolizes believers' preserving and purifying influence (Leviticus 2:13). Losing savor means losing effectiveness, which aligns with Ezekiel 36:26 about a new heart enabling true life.

This teaching deepens the commandment against adultery (Exodus 20:14) to include internal desires, consistent with Jeremiah 17:9 on the deceitfulness of the heart, and 1 John 2:16 about lust being sinful.
