          "explanation": "2 Samuel 20:1 describes Sheba as a man of Belial who blew a trumpet and declared that Israel had no part in David, urging them to separate. This reflects the biblical theme of rebellion against God's anointed (1 Samuel 15:23, Psalm 2:2, Acts 5:29, Romans 13:1).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Israel followed Sheba, but Judah remained loyal to David",
          "explanation": "2 Samuel 20:2 states that the men of Israel went after Sheba, but the men of Judah cleaved to their king, David. This division highlights the theme of loyalty to God's chosen leader (Genesis 49:10, Deuteronomy 17:15, Psalm 89:20-37, John 19:19-22).",
