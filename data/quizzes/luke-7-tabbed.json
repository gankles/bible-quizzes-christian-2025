          "explanation": "Jesus declared John the Baptist the greatest prophet born of women, yet stated even the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he (Luke 7:28). This stresses John's pivotal role in salvation history as the forerunner of Christ and introduces the inaugurated kingdom (Malachi 3:1; Isaiah 40:3; Matthew 11:11; Revelation 1:5).",

This reflects a profound recognition of Jesus' sovereign authority, paralleling the centurion’s own command over soldiers, and reveals Christ's power over illness by a word (Psalm 107:20; John 11:43; Matthew 8:8; Isaiah 55:11).",
