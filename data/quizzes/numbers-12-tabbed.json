          "question": "What was the primary reason Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses in Numbers 12?",
          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "Because Moses married an Ethiopian woman",
            "Because Moses did not consult them",
            "Because Moses was too meek",
            "Because Moses claimed to be a prophet"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Because Moses married an Ethiopian woman",
          "explanation": "Numbers 12:1 states that Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman he had married. This highlights issues of familial tension and prejudice, which God addresses by affirming Moses' unique role. Similarly, James 2:1-4 condemns partiality, and Galatians 3:28 emphasizes unity in Christ regardless of ethnicity.",

            "Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? Hath he not spoken also by us?",

            "Why must we follow Moses and not another?"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? Hath he not spoken also by us?",
          "explanation": "Numbers 12:2 captures Miriam and Aaron questioning whether the LORD has spoken only through Moses, challenging his exclusive prophetic role. This is contrasted with Deuteronomy 34:10 which confirms Moses as the unique prophet. Hebrews 3:1-6 also highlights Moses as a faithful servant and type of Christ.",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Very meek, above all men upon the earth",
          "explanation": "Numbers 12:3 describes Moses as 'very meek,' indicating humility and submission to God despite his leadership. This aligns with Philippians 2:5-8 where Christ exemplifies humility, and contrasts with pride as the root of sin (Proverbs 16:18).",

          "explanation": "Numbers 12:4 instructs the three to come to the tabernacle of the congregation, the central place of God's presence among Israel. This prefigures Christ as the true meeting place between God and man (John 1:14) and the temple as God's dwelling (Ephesians 2:21-22).",

            "A dove descending"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "The pillar of the cloud",
          "explanation": "Numbers 12:5 describes the LORD coming down in the pillar of cloud, signifying His presence and guidance. This echoes Exodus 13:21-22 and symbolizes God's guidance by the Spirit (John 1:32) and His glory dwelling with His people (Revelation 21:3).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "In a vision and by a dream",
          "explanation": "Numbers 12:6 reveals that God speaks to prophets through visions and dreams, emphasizing the supernatural nature of prophetic revelation as seen in Joel 2:28 and Acts 2:17. This shows the variety of God's communicative methods.",

          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "God speaks with Moses mouth to mouth, openly, and he sees the similitude of the LORD",
            "Moses only receives messages through dreams",
            "Moses hears God indirectly through angels",
            "Moses never sees God’s form"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "God speaks with Moses mouth to mouth, openly, and he sees the similitude of the LORD",
          "explanation": "Numbers 12:7-8 highlight Moses’ unparalleled intimacy with God, speaking 'mouth to mouth' and seeing God's likeness, unlike other prophets. This intimate revelation is unique and points forward to Christ as the ultimate revelation of God (John 1:18).",

            "God's anger was kindled against them",

            "God blessed their boldness",
            "God punished Moses instead"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "God's anger was kindled against them",
          "explanation": "Numbers 12:9 shows God's anger against Miriam and Aaron for their rebellious speech, underscoring the seriousness of sin against God's chosen servant. This is consistent with God's intolerance of rebellion as in 1 Samuel 15:23 and Hebrews 12:29.",

            "She was cast out immediately"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "She became leprous, white as snow",
          "explanation": "Numbers 12:10 records Miriam becoming leprous, symbolizing impurity and separation due to sin, paralleling the Old Testament use of leprosy as divine judgment (Leviticus 13). This foreshadows spiritual uncleanness and the need for cleansing (1 Corinthians 6:11).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Do not lay the sin upon us, and let her not be as one dead",
          "explanation": "In Numbers 12:11-12, Aaron appeals to Moses not to hold their sin against them and not to let Miriam die like one whose flesh is half consumed, showing his intercessory role. This echoes intercession themes in Exodus 32:11-14 and Hebrews 7:25.",

          "explanation": "Numbers 12:13 shows Moses praying for Miriam’s healing, demonstrating his role as mediator and intercessor, a type of Christ's mediatorial work (1 Timothy 2:5). This illustrates the power of prayer and compassion in leadership.",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "She was to be shut out from the camp for seven days, then received again",
          "explanation": "Numbers 12:14-15 commands Miriam’s exclusion for seven days as a period of shame and purification, then reintegration, illustrating God's justice balanced with mercy. This parallels purification rituals in Leviticus 13 and Christ's work in reconciling sinners (2 Corinthians 5:18-19).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "The people did not journey until Miriam was brought in again",
          "explanation": "Numbers 12:15 states that Israel remained encamped during Miriam’s exclusion, indicating communal dependence and respect for God's judgment. This demonstrates corporate responsibility and unity, as seen in Acts 1:14 and 1 Corinthians 12:26.",
