      "options": ["True", "False"],
      "correctAnswer": "False",
      "explanation": "Jeremiah 29:11 was originally written to the nation of Israel in Babylonian exile. While the principle of God's sovereign goodness applies broadly, the verse was not a promise of instant prosperity. It promised restoration after 70 years of captivity — a long period of suffering came first.",

      "explanation": "Jeremiah 29:12-13: 'Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.' This is a conditional promise tied to wholehearted seeking.",

      "options": ["True", "False"],
      "correctAnswer": "False",
      "explanation": "The false prophets were doing the opposite — they were promising a quick return to Jerusalem. Jeremiah warned the exiles not to listen to them (Jeremiah 29:8-9), because God had decreed a 70-year captivity. Jeremiah, not the false prophets, told them to settle down.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A hopeful outcome that God has planned and the people can confidently anticipate",
      "explanation": "The Hebrew 'acharith v'tikvah' literally means 'an end and a hope' or 'a future and a hope.' It refers to the outcome God had planned for Israel — not instant relief, but the assured culmination of His good purpose after the period of discipline was complete.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Nebuchadnezzar",
      "explanation": "Jeremiah 29:1 identifies Nebuchadnezzar as the king who carried away the captives from Jerusalem to Babylon. He besieged Jerusalem multiple times (605, 597, and 586 BC), deporting Jews in waves.",

      "id": "jer2911-q12",
      "question": "Why is it a misapplication to use Jeremiah 29:11 as a prosperity gospel proof text?",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "options": [
        "Because the original context was a promise of restoration after 70 years of suffering in exile, not a guarantee of immediate comfort",
        "Because the verse is not actually in the Bible",
        "Because it was written only for priests, not laypeople",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Because the original context was a promise of restoration after 70 years of suffering in exile, not a guarantee of immediate comfort",
      "explanation": "Jeremiah 29:11 is often quoted out of context to promise instant blessing. In reality, it was spoken to people in the middle of divine judgment (Babylonian exile). The promise was that God's plan would be fulfilled — but only after 70 years of captivity. God's good plan included suffering before restoration.",

      "type": "true-false",
      "options": ["True", "False"],
      "correctAnswer": "False",
      "explanation": "Jeremiah was deeply unpopular. He was beaten, imprisoned, thrown into a cistern, and rejected by kings, priests, false prophets, and the people because his message of judgment and submission to Babylon was unwelcome (Jeremiah 20:2, 37:15, 38:6).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Do not let them deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams they encourage you to have",
      "explanation": "Jeremiah 29:8-9: 'For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed. For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD.'",
