          "correctAnswer": "The scattering of peoples and languages post-Tower of Babel",
          "explanation": "1 Chronicles 1:19 states that Peleg was named because 'in his days the earth was divided.' This corresponds to the Babel event in Genesis 11:1-9, where God confounded human language and scattered people. Theologically, it shows God's sovereign intervention in human history to limit sin's spread and to begin the formation of distinct nations ordained for His redemptive purposes (Acts 17:26-27, Deuteronomy 32:8).",
