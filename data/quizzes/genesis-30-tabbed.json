          "explanation": "In Genesis 30:2, Jacob says, 'Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?' indicating God's exclusive authority over fertility. This aligns with Exodus 23:26 where God promises no miscarriages or barrenness. Deuteronomy 7:14 also speaks of God's blessing of fruitfulness. 1 Samuel 1:11 shows Hannah praying for a child, recognizing God's sovereign gift. John 15:5 teaches that apart from Christ, we can do nothing, reinforcing divine sovereignty.",

          "explanation": "Genesis 30:3-4 recount Rachel giving Bilhah to Jacob to bear children on her behalf, an attempt to control God's promise of offspring. This reflects human impatience seen also in Abram and Sarai with Hagar (Genesis 16). Psalm 127:1 reminds that unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain.

The Old Testament often records polygamy without explicit condemnation (e.g., Abraham, David).
