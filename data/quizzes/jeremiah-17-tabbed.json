This is echoed in Genesis 6:5, Jeremiah 17:10 about God searching the heart, and Jesus’ teaching in Mark 7:21-23 on the evil that proceeds from the heart. Romans 3:10-18 also underscores humanity’s inherent sinfulness.",

          "explanation": "Jeremiah 17:10 affirms God's omniscience and justice, as He searches the heart and rewards or punishes according to deeds. This reflects biblical theology seen in 1 Samuel 16:7 where God judges the heart, Romans 2:6 about God rendering to each according to works, and Hebrews 4:12-13 concerning God's piercing knowledge of human hearts.",

This role as a public prophet echoes Nehemiah 8:1-2 where the law is read publicly, and Acts 5:20 where the apostles are instructed to speak in the temple and streets.
