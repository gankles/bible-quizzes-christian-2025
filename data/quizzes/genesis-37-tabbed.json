          "correctAnswer": "It illustrates God's sovereign grace in bestowing favor despite human imperfections.",
          "explanation": "Genesis 37:3 shows Jacob's special love for Joseph, reflecting God’s sovereign grace choosing Joseph despite family dynamics. Similarly, God's sovereign grace is evident in Romans 9:11-13 where God's choice is not based on works but His own purpose. Also, Ephesians 1:4-6 emphasizes God's predestining grace, and Psalm 139:13-16 highlights God's intentional creation of each life.",

          "correctAnswer": "It prophetically points to Christ's exaltation over all peoples and nations.",
          "explanation": "Genesis 37:7 depicts Joseph's sheaf standing and others bowing, a type of Christ's future exaltation as King of kings (Philippians 2:9-11). Psalm 110:1 also speaks of all enemies being made a footstool, and Revelation 5:13 reveals universal worship before Christ. This dream foreshadows God's sovereign plan for salvation history.",

          "explanation": "Genesis 37:4 and 37:8 highlight the brothers’ hatred due to jealousy, illustrating how sin corrupts human relationships (James 3:14-16). Proverbs 27:4 warns that jealousy can inflame anger, and 1 John 2:16 identifies envy as worldly sin. This shows humanity's fallen tendency toward destructive emotions.",

          "explanation": "Genesis 37:28 describes Joseph sold for twenty pieces of silver, paralleling Judas’ betrayal of Jesus for the same amount (Matthew 26:15). Joseph’s suffering leads to salvation for many (Genesis 50:20), mirroring the redemptive work of Christ (Isaiah 53; 1 Peter 2:24). This highlights God’s providential use of evil for good.",
