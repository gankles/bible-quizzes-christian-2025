      "correctAnswer": "False",
      "explanation": "Romans 8:28 does NOT say all things ARE good — it says all things 'work together for good.' There is a critical difference. Suffering, persecution, and loss are not good in themselves, but God sovereignly works them together toward a good outcome for those who love Him.",
