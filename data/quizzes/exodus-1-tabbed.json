These cities symbolize the burden of slavery. This imagery of forced labor is echoed in Jeremiah 22:28 and 2 Chronicles 28:15, illustrating human suffering under unjust rule.",

This act of infanticide is a grave sin against God’s gift of life (Psalm 139:13-16, Jeremiah 1:5). The midwives’ refusal demonstrates obedience to God’s law over human commands (Acts 5:29).",
