          "explanation": "1 Chronicles 15:2 states clearly that David said none ought to carry the ark but the Levites, for the LORD had chosen them to carry the ark and minister to Him forever. This shows God's sovereign choice of the Levites for this holy task. Similarly, Numbers 1:50-53 and Deuteronomy 10:8 affirm the Levites' special role, while Hebrews 7:23-24 points to the eternal priesthood fulfilled in Christ.",
