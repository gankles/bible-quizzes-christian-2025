          "explanation": "Upon hearing the woman's plea, the king instructed an officer to restore all that was hers, including the fruits of the field since she left (2 Kings 8:6).

          "explanation": "Benhadad was sick when Elisha arrived in Damascus (2 Kings 8:7). This situation sets the stage for divine revelation, similar to how God reveals His will through prophets during times of kingly weakness (e.g., Hezekiah's illness in Isaiah 38).",

          "explanation": "Elisha told Hazael to say the king would recover, but God had shown him that Benhadad would surely die (2 Kings 8:10). This demonstrates God's sovereign knowledge of future events (Isaiah 46:9-10) and the prophetic role in declaring God's will (Jeremiah 1:5).",

          "explanation": "Hazael questioned, 'Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?' denying the evil he would do, though Elisha affirmed he would be king over Syria (2 Kings 8:13). This highlights human denial of sin contrasted with divine foreknowledge (Romans 3:10-18).",
