          "explanation": "The verse warns not to be hasty in leaving the king's presence because he does whatever pleases him, implying caution and respect (Ecclesiastes 8:3). This aligns with Proverbs 24:21-22 about fearing the king and God's wrath, and Romans 13:1 about submitting to authority.",
