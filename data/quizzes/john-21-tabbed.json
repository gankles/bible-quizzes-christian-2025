This prophecy aligns with early church tradition about Peter’s death and reflects the cost of faithful discipleship (Philippians 1:29; 2 Timothy 4:6-7).

This underlines the sovereignty of God in matters of life and death (Deuteronomy 32:39), and calls believers to focus on their own discipleship (Matthew 16:24).
