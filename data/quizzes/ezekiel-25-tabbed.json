This pride and scorn against God's covenant people provoke judgment. Similar themes appear in Jeremiah 48:29 and Amos 2:1-3.

Similar divine judgments on nations appear in Jeremiah 49:17-18 and Obadiah 1:10-14. The destruction of both man and beast indicates total desolation in God's just retribution (Nahum 1:3).",
