          "correctAnswer": "Wrath",
          "explanation": "1 Thessalonians 5:9 states that God has not appointed believers to wrath, but to obtain salvation through Jesus Christ. This aligns with Romans 5:9 where believers are saved from God's wrath, and 1 John 4:17 speaks of believers having confidence in the day of judgment due to salvation.",

          "explanation": "1 Thessalonians 5:10 teaches that Jesus died so that believers, whether awake or asleep (alive or dead), would live together with Him. This reflects John 11:25-26 where Jesus is the resurrection and the life, and Romans 6:8-10 speaks of believers living with Christ in newness of life.",
