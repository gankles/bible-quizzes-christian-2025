          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "His eyes were dim and he could not see",
            "He was very sick and bedridden",
            "He was speaking from a vision",
            "He was preparing to travel"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "His eyes were dim and he could not see",
          "explanation": "Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, leading him to call Esau (Genesis 27:1). This shows human frailty and the limitations of man, contrasting with God's omniscience (Psalm 33:18, Job 12:10, John 9:39, Isaiah 46:10).",

          "type": "multiple-choice",
          "options": [
            "So that he might bless Esau before he died",
            "To celebrate a festival",

            "Because he was hungry"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "So that he might bless Esau before he died",
          "explanation": "Isaac asked Esau to bring venison and prepare meat so that he might eat and bless him before he died, emphasizing the significance of blessings as covenantal and prophetic acts (Genesis 27:3-4). Blessings in Scripture often convey God's promises and favor (Numbers 6:24-26, Hebrews 6:13-14, Ephesians 1:3, Romans 4:11).",

          "options": [
            "She instructed Jacob to deceive Isaac and receive the blessing",
            "She told Esau to hurry and prepare the meal",
            "She prayed silently for Esau's blessing",
            "She confronted Isaac about his favoritism"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "She instructed Jacob to deceive Isaac and receive the blessing",
          "explanation": "Rebekah heard Isaac's words to Esau and told Jacob to obey her voice and bring her two kids to prepare the savory meat to deceive Isaac and receive the blessing (Genesis 27:5-10). This act reveals human sinfulness and God's sovereign use of human failure to accomplish His purposes (Romans 8:28, Isaiah 55:8-9, Genesis 50:20, Proverbs 16:4).",

            "He said his father might feel him and curse him",

            "He asked Esau to help him"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He said his father might feel him and curse him",
          "explanation": "Jacob worried that because he was smooth-skinned and Esau was hairy, his father might feel him and realize the deception, resulting in a curse rather than a blessing (Genesis 27:11-12). This highlights themes of human fear, deceit, and reliance on outward appearances versus God's sovereign plan (1 Samuel 16:7, Hebrews 11:1, 2 Corinthians 12:9, Jeremiah 17:9).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "She dressed him in Esau's clothes and put goat skins on his hands and neck",
          "explanation": "Rebekah took Esau's garments and put them on Jacob and covered his hands and neck with goat skins to mimic Esau's hairy skin (Genesis 27:15-16). This act of deception illustrates human sin and God's mysterious providence (Psalm 105:17-22, Romans 3:23, Genesis 50:20, Isaiah 45:7).",

          "type": "multiple-choice",

            "He felt his hands and neck for hair and listened to his voice",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He felt his hands and neck for hair and listened to his voice",
          "explanation": "Isaac checked Jacob by feeling his hands and neck because Esau was hairy, and also listened to his voice, which he recognized as Jacob's (Genesis 27:21-23). This shows human discernment limited by deception and God's overruling plan (John 1:47, Psalm 139:1-6, Jeremiah 1:5, Proverbs 3:5-6).",

            "God would give him dew of heaven, fatness of the earth, plenty of corn and wine, and dominion over his brethren",

          "correctAnswer": "God would give him dew of heaven, fatness of the earth, plenty of corn and wine, and dominion over his brethren",
          "explanation": "Isaac blessed Jacob with abundance and dominion, including dew from heaven, the fatness of the earth, and that nations would serve him, highlighting the covenantal significance of blessings (Genesis 27:28-29). This echoes promises to Abraham and is fulfilled in the messianic line (Genesis 12:3, Psalm 72:8, Matthew 5:5, Revelation 5:5).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He cried bitterly and pleaded for a blessing as well",
          "explanation": "Esau cried with a great and bitter cry and asked his father to bless him, expressing deep grief and loss over the stolen blessing (Genesis 27:34-38). This illustrates the sin of envy and the consequences of deception (James 3:14-16, Proverbs 27:4, Galatians 5:19-21, 1 John 2:16).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He said Jacob was made lord over Esau and his brothers",
          "explanation": "Isaac explained that he had made Jacob lord over Esau and his brothers, assigning servants and provision to him, indicating the irrevocable nature of the blessing (Genesis 27:37). This reinforces the biblical teaching about the permanence of God's ordained blessings (Numbers 23:19, Hebrews 6:13-18, Romans 11:29, Psalm 89:34).",

          "explanation": "Isaac prophesied that Esau's dwelling would be the fatness of the earth but he would live by the sword, serve Jacob, and eventually break his yoke (Genesis 27:39-40).

          "explanation": "Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing and said in his heart he would kill him after their father died (Genesis 27:41). This reveals the destructiveness of sin and the consequences of envy and deception (Genesis 4:8, Proverbs 27:4, James 4:1-3, Romans 1:29).",

          "explanation": "Upon hearing Esau's intent, Rebekah sent Jacob to her brother Laban in Haran to stay until Esau's anger subsided (Genesis 27:42-44). This shows a protective maternal response and God's providential preservation of Jacob, a key figure in redemptive history (Genesis 28:10-15, Exodus 2:1-10, Psalm 121:7-8, Romans 8:28).",
