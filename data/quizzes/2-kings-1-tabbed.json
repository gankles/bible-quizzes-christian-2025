          "explanation": "Elijah rebuked the messengers by pointing out that the king sought a foreign god because there was no trust in the God of Israel (2 Kings 1:3). This highlights the biblical truth that the Lord is the only true God (Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 45:5). Jesus affirms the uniqueness of God in John 17:3, and Paul reiterates this in 1 Corinthians 8:4-6.",

          "explanation": "Elijah challenged the captain by invoking God's power to send fire from heaven to consume them if he was truly a man of God (2 Kings 1:10). Fire from heaven demonstrates divine authority, paralleling Elijah's earlier confrontation with Baal's prophets on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18:36-38).

This act of humility and reverence contrasts with the rebellion of the previous captains and reflects biblical calls to approach God and His servants with humility (James 4:6; Proverbs 3:34).
