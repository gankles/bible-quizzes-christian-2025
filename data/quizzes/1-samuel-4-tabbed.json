          "options": [
            "Israel was victorious and pursued the Philistines",
            "Israel was smitten and about four thousand men were killed",
            "The battle ended in a stalemate with no casualties",
            "The Philistines fled without fighting"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Israel was smitten and about four thousand men were killed",
          "explanation": "1 Samuel 4:2 states that Israel was smitten before the Philistines and about four thousand men were slain. This shows human weakness and the consequences of not fully trusting God in battle, paralleling examples like Israel's defeat in Judges 7:2 and the warnings in Deuteronomy 28:25.",

            "Fast and pray for deliverance"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Fetch the ark of the covenant from Shiloh",
          "explanation": "According to 1 Samuel 4:3-4, the elders believed bringing the ark of the covenant would save them. This reflects a misunderstanding of God's presence and power, similar to Israel's misuse of the ark in Numbers 4:15 and contrasts with the New Testament teaching that God's presence is in the Spirit, not objects (John 4:24).",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Hophni and Phinehas",
          "explanation": "1 Samuel 4:4 identifies Eli's sons as Hophni and Phinehas who were with the ark. Their corrupt priestly behavior represents human sinfulness in spiritual leadership, a theme echoed in Ezekiel 22:26 and the New Testament warnings in 1 Timothy 3:1-7.",

            "They fled in fear"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "They shouted with a great shout",
          "explanation": "1 Samuel 4:5 says all Israel shouted so loudly that the earth rang again. This reflects a misplaced confidence in the ark itself rather than in God’s mercy, contrasting with Psalm 46:1 and Isaiah 40:31 which emphasize trust in God rather than symbols.",

            "They retreated without engaging"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "They were afraid and acknowledged God had come into the camp",
          "explanation": "Verses 1 Samuel 4:6-7 show the Philistines feared because they recognized the presence of the God of Israel, recalling His power over Egypt (Exodus 7-12). This underscores God's sovereign power over all nations, a biblical truth echoed in Isaiah 45:7 and Romans 9:17.",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Fight bravely to avoid becoming servants",
          "explanation": "1 Samuel 4:9 records the Philistines encouraging each other to be strong and fight like men to avoid servitude. This highlights human resolve in the face of divine power, reminiscent of the courage in Judges 7:3 and the call to spiritual warfare in Ephesians 6:10-12.",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Israel was defeated with great slaughter",
          "explanation": "1 Samuel 4:10 describes Israel's defeat and the death of thirty thousand footmen, showing that mere possession of religious symbols without faithfulness leads to judgment, paralleling warnings in Hosea 4:6 and Hebrews 3:12-13.",

            "The prophets were killed"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "The ark of God was taken and Eli's two sons were slain",
          "explanation": "1 Samuel 4:11 reports that the ark was captured and the two sons of Eli died, symbolizing a profound spiritual and national crisis, similar to the captivity in 2 Kings 25:7 and the cross references in Hebrews 9:4 regarding the ark's significance.",

            "He sent a message to the king"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "He fell backward, broke his neck, and died",
          "explanation": "1 Samuel 4:18 states that Eli fell backward from his seat and died when he heard the ark was taken and his sons were dead. This tragic end highlights the weight of leadership responsibility and divine judgment, resonating with Ecclesiastes 9:12 and the death of Saul in 1 Samuel 31:4.",

            "Elijah, meaning 'My God is Yahweh'"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "Ichabod, meaning 'The glory is departed from Israel'",
          "explanation": "1 Samuel 4:21 records that she named her son Ichabod because the glory had departed from Israel with the capture of the ark and death of her husband and father-in-law. This symbolizes the loss of God's manifest presence, aligned with themes in Ezekiel 10 and John 1:14 where glory relates to God's presence.",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "God’s presence cannot be manipulated or treated as a talisman",
          "explanation": "The defeat despite the ark’s presence (1 Samuel 4:3-11) teaches that God's power is not a magical object but requires obedience and faith, consistent with Deuteronomy 28:15 and Jesus’ teaching in Matthew 23:23 about true faithfulness.",

          "correctAnswer": "A moment of judgment and call to repentance",
          "explanation": "The ark’s capture (1 Samuel 4:11) represents God's judgment on Israel’s unfaithfulness, not abandonment, echoing Deuteronomy 31:16 and Hosea 6:1 urging repentance and restoration, consistent with God's covenantal faithfulness.",
