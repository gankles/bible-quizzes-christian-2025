This shows the legal and political context of Jesus' trial, emphasizing human authority's role in the divine plan of redemption (Acts 4:27-28).

This highlights Jesus' innocence despite the accusations, fulfilling the righteous servant prophecy (Isaiah 53:9) and Christ's sinless nature (1 Peter 2:22).

          "explanation": "Simon, a Cyrenian, was compelled to carry Jesus' cross (Luke 23:26).
