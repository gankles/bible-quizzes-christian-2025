          "explanation": "The chapter states that passersby will be astonished and hiss, questioning why the LORD has done this, and the answer will be Israel's forsaking of God and worship of other gods, leading to judgment (1 Kings 9:8-9). This is consistent with prophetic warnings about the consequences of idolatry (Isaiah 65:1-7; Ezekiel 8:6-18; Jeremiah 22:9-10; Psalm 78:56-58).",

          "explanation": "Solomon imposed a tribute of bondservice on the remaining non-Israelite peoples in the land whom Israel could not fully destroy (1 Kings 9:20-21). This reflects biblical themes of subjugation of conquered peoples (Numbers 33:50-56; Joshua 11:23; 2 Chronicles 8:7-9).",
