      "summary": "The son of Solomon and Naamah, Rehoboam became king of Israel at age 41 after his father's death. When the people asked him to lighten the heavy burdens Solomon had imposed, Rehoboam foolishly rejected the counsel of elders and followed young advisors, threatening even harsher treatment. This led to the rebellion of the ten northern tribes, leaving Rehoboam ruling only Judah and Benjamin. His reign saw invasions and continued idolatry.",
      "significance": "Rehoboam's foolish pride divided the united kingdom of Israel, fulfilling God's judgment on Solomon's idolatry and creating the separate kingdoms of Israel and Judah.",

      "summary": "The third king of Judah and son of Abijah, Asa did what was right in the Lord's eyes like his ancestor David. He removed male cult prostitutes, destroyed idols, and even removed his grandmother Maacah from being queen mother because of her Asherah pole. Asa defeated the Ethiopian army through faith in God, and Judah enjoyed peace for much of his reign. However, later he relied on Syria instead of God and imprisoned the prophet who rebuked him.",

God vindicated His chosen leaders by causing the earth to open and swallow Korah and his followers, and fire consumed the 250 who offered incense.",
