The hyperbolic \"tongues of angels\" (possibly referencing celestial praise languages) sets the highest imaginable standard for eloquence.<br><br><strong>And have not charity</strong> (ἀγάπην δὲ μὴ ἔχω, <em>agapēn de mē echō</em>)—<em>Agapē</em> is self-sacrificial, covenant love modeled supremely in Christ's death (Romans 5:8). Unlike <em>phileo</em> (affection) or <em>eros</em> (desire), <em>agapē</em> chooses the good of others regardless of reciprocation. Paul uses the strong adversative <em>de</em> to contrast gifts with character.<br><br><strong>I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal</strong> (γέγονα χαλκὸς ἠχῶν ἢ κύμβαλον ἀλαλάζον, <em>gegona chalkos ēchōn ē kymbalon alalazon</em>)—The perfect tense <em>gegona</em> indicates a settled state of worthlessness. Ancient temples used bronze gongs and clashing cymbals in pagan worship—loud, attention-grabbing, but meaningless cacophony. Without love, even supernatural speech is just religious noise.",
        "historical": "Written circa 55 AD from Ephesus during Paul's third missionary journey to a divided Corinthian church. Corinth was a cosmopolitan port notorious for immorality and religious pluralism. The church, influenced by Greek philosophy's love of wisdom and rhetoric, competed over spiritual gifts, particularly tongues (chapters 12-14). Chapter 13 interrupts this discussion to establish love as the \"more excellent way\" (12:31).",

        "analysis": "<strong>And though I have the gift of prophecy</strong> (καὶ ἐὰν ἔχω προφητείαν, <em>kai ean echō prophēteian</em>)—Paul now addresses a gift he ranked highest for edification (14:1-5). <em>Prophēteia</em> means inspired proclamation of God's truth, not merely prediction. Even this supremely valuable gift becomes worthless without love.<br><br><strong>And understand all mysteries, and all knowledge</strong> (καὶ εἰδῶ τὰ μυστήρια πάντα καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γνῶσιν, <em>kai eidō ta mystēria panta kai pasan tēn gnōsin</em>)—<em>Mystēria</em> refers to divine secrets revealed only by God (1 Corinthians 2:7; Romans 11:25; Ephesians 3:3-9). <em>Gnōsis</em> is comprehensive understanding. Paul's hyperbolic \"all mysteries and all knowledge\" includes theological mastery, biblical expertise, and supernatural insight—the very knowledge Corinthians prized (1 Corinthians 8:1).<br><br><strong>And though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing</strong> (οὐθέν εἰμι, <em>outhen eimi</em>)—Jesus promised mountain-moving faith to His disciples (Matthew 17:20; 21:21). <em>Outhen</em> is absolute zero, not \"little\" but literally \"nothing.\" Without love, even miracle-working faith reduces the miracle-worker to ontological nothingness.",
        "historical": "The Corinthians' obsession with knowledge (<em>gnōsis</em>) appears throughout the letter: \"knowledge puffs up, but love builds up\" (8:1), their false wisdom (1:18-25), divisions over teachers (1:12; 3:4-7). Greek philosophical schools in Corinth emphasized esoteric knowledge and mystery religions offered secret revelations. Paul insists Christian maturity isn't measured by spiritual information but Christlike love.",

        "analysis": "<strong>And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor</strong> (κἂν ψωμίσω πάντα τὰ ὑπάρχοντά μου, <em>kan psōmisō panta ta hyparchonta mou</em>)—<em>Psōmizō</em> literally means \"to feed morsel by morsel,\" suggesting gradual, deliberate distribution of one's entire estate. This is radical generosity, total divestment for charity—the highest imaginable sacrifice in a patronage-based society where wealth meant status, security, and honor.<br><br><strong>And though I give my body to be burned</strong> (καὶ ἐὰν παραδῶ τὸ σῶμά μου ἵνα καυχήσωμαι, <em>kai ean paradō to sōma mou hina kauchēsōmai</em>)—Most manuscripts read <em>kauchēsōmai</em> (\"that I may boast\") rather than <em>kauthēsōmai</em> (\"to be burned\"), though both appear in tradition. The concept is martyrdom—ultimate self-sacrifice, possibly referencing Daniel's friends (Daniel 3) or anticipating Christian persecution. Yet even dying for one's faith is worthless if motivated by pride rather than love.<br><br><strong>And have not charity, it profiteth me nothing</strong> (οὐδὲν ὠφελοῦμαι, <em>ouden ōpheloumai</em>)—I gain zero benefit. Paul's third escalation moves from being nothing (v. 2) to gaining nothing. Without <em>agapē</em>, even seemingly selfless acts—total charity, martyrdom—are spiritually bankrupt. Motive matters as much as action.",
        "historical": "In the honor-shame culture of the Roman Empire, public benefaction (<em>euergetism</em>) brought social status and immortal fame. Wealthy citizens funded games, buildings, and grain distributions to be praised as public benefactors. Jewish tradition also honored almsgiving and martyrdom (2 Maccabees 6-7). Paul radically reorients motivation: acts done for glory or self-justification, not love, profit nothing eternally.",

        "analysis": "<strong>Charity suffereth long</strong> (ἡ ἀγάπη μακροθυμεῖ, <em>hē agapē makrothymei</em>)—Paul begins defining love's positive qualities. <em>Makrothymeō</em> means \"long-tempered\" (literally \"long passion\"), the opposite of quick-tempered. It's patience under provocation, enduring difficult people without retaliation. God's own <em>makrothymia</em> delays judgment to allow repentance (Romans 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9).<br><br><strong>And is kind</strong> (χρηστεύεται, <em>chrēsteuetai</em>)—<em>Chrēsteuomai</em> appears only here in the NT, meaning actively benevolent, showing practical goodness. Love doesn't merely refrain from harm (patience) but actively does good (kindness). These two qualities form love's foundational posture: enduring and generous.<br><br><strong>Charity envieth not</strong> (οὐ ζηλοῖ, <em>ou zēloi</em>)—<em>Zēloō</em> can mean healthy zeal or sinful jealousy; context determines meaning. Here, negative: love doesn't envy others' gifts, possessions, or status. This directly confronts Corinthian jealousy over spiritual gifts (3:3; 12:31).<br><br><strong>Charity vaunteth not itself</strong> (οὐ περπερεύεται, <em>ou perpereuetai</em>)—This rare verb (appears only here in biblical Greek) means boastful self-display or bragging. Love doesn't parade achievements or seek recognition.<br><br><strong>Is not puffed up</strong> (οὐ φυσιοῦται, <em>ou physioutai</em>)—<em>Physioō</em> is Paul's favorite term for arrogance in 1 Corinthians (4:6, 18, 19; 5:2; 8:1). Literally \"inflated,\" it describes pride that puffs up with self-importance. Love deflates ego.",
        "historical": "The Corinthian church was rife with competition: factions boasting of teachers (1:12; 3:21; 4:6), arrogance over knowledge (8:1), divisions at the Lord's Supper (11:17-22), and jealousy over gifts (12:14-26). Greco-Roman society rewarded self-promotion and honor-seeking. Against this, Paul presents love as patient, kind, humble, and non-competitive—radically countercultural in ancient Corinth and modern Western culture.",
        "questions": [
          "Which of these five qualities—patience, kindness, contentment, humility, or selflessness—most challenges you in your closest relationships?",
          "How does social media culture encourage the very self-promotion ('vaunting') and envy that Paul says love rejects?",

        "analysis": "<strong>Doth not behave itself unseemly</strong> (οὐκ ἀσχημονεῖ, <em>ouk aschēmonei</em>)—<em>Aschēmoneō</em> means to act dishonorably, rudely, or indecently (cf. 7:36). Love respects propriety and others' dignity, refusing to shame or disgrace. This contrasts with the Corinthians' shameful behavior at the Lord's Supper (11:20-22) and chaotic worship (14:23, 40).<br><br><strong>Seeketh not her own</strong> (οὐ ζητεῖ τὰ ἑαυτῆς, <em>ou zētei ta heautēs</em>)—Love is fundamentally other-centered, the opposite of selfish ambition. Paul models this (10:24, 33) and commands it (Philippians 2:4). Christ supremely embodied it (Philippians 2:5-8). This demolishes Corinthian factionalism, litigation (6:1-8), and selfish use of Christian liberty (8:9-13).<br><br><strong>Is not easily provoked</strong> (οὐ παροξύνεται, <em>ou paroxunetai</em>)—Literally \"not sharpened\" or irritated. The same verb describes Paul's spirit being \"provoked\" by Athenian idolatry (Acts 17:16) and the sharp disagreement between Paul and Barnabas (Acts 15:39). Love maintains composure under irritation, refusing to be baited into anger.<br><br><strong>Thinketh no evil</strong> (οὐ λογίζεται τὸ κακόν, <em>ou logizetai to kakon</em>)—<em>Logizomai</em> is an accounting term meaning \"to reckon, calculate, keep records.\" Love doesn't keep a mental ledger of wrongs for future use in arguments or revenge. This is the opposite of nursing grievances. As God doesn't count our sins against us when we're in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:19), so love forgives and forgets.",
        "historical": "Ancient Mediterranean culture was built on honor-shame dynamics and reciprocity—keeping careful accounts of slights, favors, and debts. Legal disputes (6:1-8), factions (1:10-13), and competition over status (4:8-13) all reflect this cultural obsession with personal rights and vindication. Paul's call to not 'think evil' (keep accounts) is a radical departure from both Greco-Roman and Jewish honor culture.",

        "analysis": "<strong>Rejoiceth not in iniquity</strong> (οὐ χαίρει ἐπὶ τῇ ἀδικίᾳ, <em>ou chairei epi tē adikia</em>)—<em>Adikia</em> is unrighteousness, injustice, wrongdoing. Love finds no joy when evil occurs, even when it might benefit oneself. This confronts the human tendency toward schadenfreude—pleasure at enemies' failures—and the Corinthian factions who likely celebrated rival groups' moral stumbles.<br><br><strong>But rejoiceth in the truth</strong> (συγχαίρει δὲ τῇ ἀληθείᾳ, <em>synchairei de tē alētheia</em>)—The compound verb <em>synchairō</em> intensifies the joy: \"rejoices together with\" the truth. <em>Alētheia</em> encompasses both propositional truth (doctrine) and reality as God defines it (righteousness, justice, gospel). Love aligns itself completely with truth's triumph, not personal vindication. This is profoundly countercultural: love celebrates righteousness even in opponents, mourns sin even in allies.<br><br>The contrast exposes the connection between love and truth—they are inseparable. John writes, \"I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth\" (3 John 1:4). Love doesn't sentimentally tolerate evil or relativize truth; it grieves over sin (even when convenient) and celebrates truth (even when costly).",
        "historical": "In Corinth's factional culture, believers took sides over teachers (Apollos vs. Paul, 1:12), celebrated their group's superiority, and likely delighted in opponents' failures. The honor-shame society thrived on public vindication. Both Greco-Roman and Jewish culture knew the impulse to celebrate enemies' downfall (cf. Obadiah 12). Paul demands love that transcends tribal loyalty to align with God's truth.",

        "analysis": "<strong>Beareth all things</strong> (πάντα στέγει, <em>panta stegei</em>)—<em>Stegō</em> has two possible meanings: (1) \"to cover\" (as a roof covers), suggesting love protects others by covering their faults (cf. 1 Peter 4:8, \"love covers a multitude of sins\"); (2) \"to bear up under,\" suggesting endurance. Both nuances fit: love both shields and endures.<br><br><strong>Believeth all things</strong> (πάντα πιστεύει, <em>panta pisteuei</em>)—Not gullible credulity, but trusting others in the best possible light. Love doesn't assume the worst, isn't cynical or suspicious, gives the benefit of the doubt. This doesn't mean naïveté—Jesus \"knew what was in man\" (John 2:24-25)—but rather refusing to prejudge or assume malice.<br><br><strong>Hopeth all things</strong> (πάντα ἐλπίζει, <em>panta elpizei</em>)—<em>Elpizō</em> is confident expectation, not wishful thinking. Love maintains hope for others' redemption, growth, and change. It doesn't write people off as hopeless cases. This hope rests in God's transforming power, not human potential.<br><br><strong>Endureth all things</strong> (πάντα ὑπομένει, <em>panta hypomenei</em>)—<em>Hypomenō</em> means steadfast perseverance under trial. Love doesn't quit when relationships become difficult. The four <em>panta</em> (\"all things\") emphasize love's comprehensive, unwavering character. Together they present love as protective, trusting, hopeful, and persistent—the very opposite of the Corinthians' quick divisions and broken relationships.",
        "historical": "The Corinthian church exhibited the opposite of these qualities: divisions instead of covering faults (1:10-13), suspicion and judgment instead of believing the best (4:1-5), giving up on difficult brothers (5:1-5; 6:1-8), and abandoning relational endurance. Roman society quickly severed relationships when inconvenient. Paul presents Christ's love—which covered our sins, believed in our redemption, hoped for our transformation, and endured the cross—as the model.",

        "analysis": "<strong>Charity never faileth</strong> (ἡ ἀγάπη οὐδέποτε πίπτει, <em>hē agapē oudepote piptei</em>)—<em>Piptō</em> means \"to fall\" or \"fail.\" Love never collapses, expires, or becomes obsolete. Unlike gifts that are temporary tools for this age, love is eternal. This introduces the contrast between transient gifts and permanent love (verses 8-13).<br><br><strong>But whether there be prophecies, they shall fail</strong> (εἴτε προφητεῖαι, καταργηθήσονται, <em>eite prophēteiai, katargēthēsontai</em>)—<em>Katargeō</em> means \"to render inoperative, abolish, nullify.\" Prophecy, so valued by Paul (14:1), will be abolished when we see Christ face to face and no longer need mediated revelation.<br><br><strong>Whether there be tongues, they shall cease</strong> (εἴτε γλῶσσαι, παύσονται, <em>eite glōssai, pausontai</em>)—<em>Pauō</em> means \"to stop, come to an end.\" Tongues, the Corinthians' prized gift, will simply stop when their purpose is fulfilled. The middle voice suggests they will cease on their own.<br><br><strong>Whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away</strong> (εἴτε γνῶσις, καταργηθήσεται, <em>eite gnōsis, katargēthēsetai</em>)—Even <em>gnōsis</em> (theological knowledge, doctrinal understanding) will be abolished in glory. Not because truth changes, but because partial knowledge gives way to complete knowledge. The three most celebrated gifts in Corinth—prophecy, tongues, knowledge—are temporary. Only love endures into eternity.",
        "historical": "By AD 55, the Corinthian church had elevated spiritual gifts (especially tongues and knowledge) as markers of spiritual maturity. Chapter 13 interrupts Paul's extended discussion (12-14) to relativize these gifts. In eternity, when we're with Christ, there will be no need for prophecy (we'll see Him), tongues (we'll communicate perfectly), or partial knowledge (we'll know fully). But love will continue forever.",

Our current theological understanding, biblical expertise, and spiritual insight are fragmentary, incomplete. Even our best grasp of God's truth is like seeing individual puzzle pieces without the full picture.<br><br><strong>And we prophesy in part</strong> (καὶ ἐκ μέρους προφητεύομεν, <em>kai ek merous prophēteuomen</em>)—Even Spirit-inspired proclamation is partial. Prophets don't have comprehensive revelation; they speak what God gives them in the moment. The repetition of <em>ek merous</em> emphasizes the limitation: all current spiritual gifts operate within the constraints of this age.<br><br>This verse grounds the previous statement (v. 8) that gifts will be abolished. Why? Because they're partial by nature. Prophecy and knowledge are like scaffolding around a building under construction—necessary now, but removed when the building is complete. Paul is preparing for verse 12's contrast: now we see dimly, then face to face.",

Context strongly favors the first: the next verse contrasts childhood with maturity, and verse 12 contrasts present obscurity with seeing \"face to face\"—clearly eschatological language echoing Numbers 12:8 and 1 John 3:2.<br><br><strong>Then that which is in part shall be done away</strong> (τὸ ἐκ μέρους καταργηθήσεται, <em>to ek merous katargēthēsetai</em>)—The same verb from verse 8: \"abolished, rendered inoperative.\" When completeness arrives, partiality becomes obsolete.

Paul uses three verbs to encompass all aspects of childish thinking: speaking (communication), understanding (comprehension), and reasoning (logic). Children's cognitive abilities are limited—they think concretely, not abstractly; they're self-focused, not other-aware; they lack perspective and wisdom.<br><br><strong>But when I became a man, I put away childish things</strong> (ὅτε γέγονα ἀνήρ, κατήργηκα τὰ τοῦ νηπίου, <em>hote gegona anēr, katērgēka ta tou nēpiou</em>)—<em>Anēr</em> is adult male, mature man. <em>Katargeō</em> (the same verb as verses 8, 10) means \"I abolished, rendered inoperative.\" Maturity requires putting away not just childish actions but childish ways of thinking.

But does \"now\" mean \"in this age\" (so faith and hope also cease in glory) or \"from now on into eternity\" (so all three continue forever)?
