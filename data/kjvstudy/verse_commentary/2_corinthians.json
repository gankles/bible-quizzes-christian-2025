The same proclamation produces opposite effects: life for some, death for others. This anticipates verse 16's stark question.

Yet <em>chairō</em> (rejoice) modified by <em>aei</em> ('always,' 'continually') indicates simultaneous, constant joy. This isn't emotional denial but spiritual depth: joy rooted in God's presence and promises coexists with sorrow over sin, suffering, and unbelief (cf.

Paul possessed little materially (Phil 4:11-12; 1 Cor 4:11) yet enriched countless souls with gospel wealth. <em>Ploutizō</em> (to make rich) refers primarily to spiritual enrichment (1 Cor 1:5; Eph 3:8; Col 1:27), though it may also include the practical generosity Paul taught (2 Cor 8-9). This inverts worldly values: spiritual wealth infinitely surpasses material prosperity.<br><br><strong>As having nothing, and yet possessing all things</strong> (ὡς μηδὲν ἔχοντες καὶ πάντα κατέχοντες, <em>hōs mēden echontes kai panta katechontes</em>)—<em>Mēden</em> ('nothing,' emphatic form) expresses absolute material poverty. Yet <em>panta</em> ('all things') modified by <em>katechō</em> (possess, hold fast) indicates comprehensive spiritual wealth. Believers own nothing yet inherit everything in Christ (1 Cor 3:21-23; Rom 8:32)—the entire created order becomes their possession through union with the heir of all things.<br><br>This final triad climaxes the paradox series with three contrasts that define Christian existence: simultaneous sorrow and joy, poverty and enrichment, nothingness and all-ness.

In ultimate spiritual realities, they have no common ground, no shared inheritance, no mutual spiritual life.<br><br>Paul escalates from abstract concepts (righteousness/unrighteousness, light/darkness) to personal embodiments (Christ/Satan, believer/unbeliever).

Paul's fifth rhetorical question reaches the climax: God's temple cannot coexist with idols—this would be the abomination of desolation itself.<br><br><strong>For ye are the temple of the living God</strong> (ἡμεῖς γὰρ ναὸς θεοῦ ἐσμεν ζῶντος, <em>hēmeis gar naos theou esmen zōntos</em>)—Paul answers his own question by identifying believers corporately as God's temple. <em>Theos zōn</em> (living God) contrasts with dead idols (Ps 115:4-7).
