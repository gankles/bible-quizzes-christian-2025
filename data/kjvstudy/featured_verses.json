Thanksgiving shifts our focus from our problems to our Provider, from our limitations to His limitless resources.",

This isn't denying pain or pretending hardship doesn't hurt, but recognizing that God uses trials to develop perseverance and spiritual maturity. When we embrace this perspective, we can be grateful even for challenges because we trust God's refining work in our lives.",

The promise 'I will never leave you' becomes the foundation for lasting contentment.",
