This divine love is not contingent upon your merit, worthiness, or performance—it proceeds from God's very nature, for 'God is love' (1 John 4:8).<br><br>While we were yet sinners, Christ died for the ungodly, demonstrating the Father's love in the most profound manner imaginable. This love is eternal, unchanging, and perfectly holy.<br><br>It is not mere sentiment but covenant faithfulness, expressed supremely in the gift of His only begotten Son. Understanding this foundational truth transforms how you view yourself, your salvation, and your relationship with your Creator."

This is no mere moral reformation or religious decision, but a divine act of regeneration wherein the Holy Spirit imparts spiritual life to one previously dead in trespasses and sins. You have become a new creation in Christ Jesus—the old nature with its affections and desires has passed away, and behold, all things have become new.<br><br>This regeneration is not of your own doing, not of works lest any man should boast, but is the gift of God accomplished by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost. You are now God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works."

There you will find encouragement, accountability, teaching, and opportunities for service as you grow in grace together with fellow saints."
