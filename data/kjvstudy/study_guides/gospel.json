        "content": "The gospel is the 'good news' of God's redemptive work through Jesus Christ—the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes. Paul delivered this gospel as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, was buried, and rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.<br><br>This message is not man's invention but divine revelation, not one gospel among many but the only gospel. The Apostle pronounced a solemn anathema upon anyone preaching a different gospel, even an angel from heaven.<br><br>The gospel brings life and immortality to light, revealing God's remedy for humanity's desperate condition and His provision for eternal reconciliation."

        "content": "The gospel begins with the character of God—He is perfectly holy, His throne established in righteousness, His eyes too pure to look upon evil. The seraphim cry continually, 'Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts.' This holiness forms the immovable standard against which all human conduct is measured.<br><br>Yet 'all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.' Sin has created a chasm between humanity and the Creator, for our iniquities have separated us from our God. We were born in sin, shaped in iniquity, spiritually dead in trespasses and sins.<br><br>This diagnosis, though devastating, is essential—only those who know they are sick will seek the Physician, only those who understand their condemnation will flee to the Savior."

        ],
        "content": "God's holiness demands that sin be punished—'the wages of sin is death.' This encompasses physical death, spiritual separation from God, and eternal condemnation in the lake of fire. 'The soul that sinneth, it shall die,' declares divine justice.<br><br>He that believes not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him. This wrath is not capricious anger but righteous indignation against wickedness, the settled opposition of God's holiness to all evil.<br><br>The gospel reveals both the righteousness of God and the wrath of God—His wrath against sin makes His provision of salvation infinitely precious. Apart from Christ, every soul stands under condemnation, awaiting the judgment of the great white throne."

        "content": "The heart of the gospel is Christ's substitutionary atonement. God made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.<br><br>Jesus lived a perfectly sinless life, fulfilling all righteousness and obeying the law completely. Yet He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities—the chastisement of our peace was upon Him.<br><br>All we like sheep have gone astray, and the LORD laid on Him the iniquity of us all. He bore our sins in His own body on the tree, suffering the just for the unjust.<br><br>At the cross, divine justice and divine mercy met—justice was satisfied as Christ bore the penalty we deserved; mercy triumphed as God provided the sacrifice He required. Christ appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself."

        "content": "The resurrection constitutes essential gospel truth—Christ was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures. This resurrection declared Him to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness.<br><br>Without the resurrection, our faith would be vain and we would yet be in our sins. But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, become the firstfruits of them that slept.<br><br>Through His resurrection, He disarmed principalities and powers, making a public spectacle of them and triumphing over them in the cross. Death could not hold the Author of Life—He conquered the grave, defeated Satan, and secured eternal redemption.<br><br>The empty tomb validates Christ's claims, confirms His finished work, and guarantees our future resurrection."

        ],
        "content": "The gospel demands a response—repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus proclaimed, 'Repent ye, and believe the gospel.' Repentance is not mere sorrow for sin's consequences but a change of mind resulting in a change of direction—turning from sin to God, from self-righteousness to Christ's righteousness.<br><br>God now commands all men everywhere to repent. Faith is wholehearted trust in Christ's person and finished work, casting oneself entirely upon Him for salvation.<br><br>It is by grace through faith that we are saved, not of works lest any man should boast. This faith involves believing that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, confessing Him as Lord, and trusting that God raised Him from the dead.<br><br>Faith and repentance are inseparable—two sides of the same coin of conversion."

        ],
        "content": "The gospel produces immediate and eternal results. Believers are justified by faith—declared righteous before God, their sins forgiven, Christ's righteousness imputed to their account.<br><br>Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. We are also adopted into God's family—no longer slaves but sons, no longer enemies but beloved children.<br><br>For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. Furthermore, believers become new creations in Christ—old things pass away, all things become new.<br><br>This is not mere moral improvement but supernatural regeneration, accomplished by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost. The gospel transforms rebels into sons, condemned sinners into justified saints, spiritually dead souls into new creatures alive unto God."

        ],
        "content": "Having received the gospel, believers bear responsibility to proclaim it. Christ commanded, 'Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.' How shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard?<br><br>And how shall they hear without a preacher? Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.<br><br>God has committed to us the ministry of reconciliation, making us ambassadors for Christ, beseeching men to be reconciled to God. We are witnesses unto Him, empowered by the Holy Ghost to testify of His death and resurrection.<br><br>This commission extends to all believers—we must give an answer to every man that asks us a reason of the hope that is in us with meekness and fear. The gospel is too precious to hoard, too powerful to hide, too urgent to delay proclaiming."
