        "content": "Scripture is God-breathed—not merely human reflection on spiritual matters but the very words of God communicated through human authors. 'All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.' Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.<br><br>For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. The Holy Spirit so superintended the biblical writers that, using their own personalities, backgrounds, and styles, they wrote exactly what God intended—without error in the original manuscripts.<br><br>This inspiration extends to every word (verbal), covering all subjects addressed (plenary). Scripture is therefore not merely a record of revelation but is itself revelation.<br><br>What Scripture says, God says. To disbelieve Scripture is to disbelieve God; to obey Scripture is to obey God."

        "content": "Because Scripture is God-breathed and God cannot lie, the Bible is without error in all it affirms—inerrant in its original manuscripts and infallible in its purposes. 'The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.' Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.<br><br>Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. Jesus declared, 'The scripture cannot be broken.' Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law.<br><br>Inerrancy means Scripture speaks truth in everything it addresses—history, science, geography, theology. It does not mean using modern scientific language or addressing every question we might ask.<br><br>Infallibility means Scripture will accomplish God's purposes without fail. These doctrines are not imposed on Scripture but derived from Scripture's self-testimony and its divine origin.<br><br>A God who cannot lie produced a Word that cannot err. To deny inerrancy is ultimately to question God's character and Christ's authority, for He affirmed Scripture's complete trustworthiness."

        "content": "Scripture possesses supreme authority over all matters of faith and practice—the final court of appeal for what we believe and how we live. 'To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.' Jesus rebuked Satan with 'It is written,' making Scripture the decisive authority.<br><br>The Bereans were commended because they 'searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so'—testing even apostolic teaching by Scripture. For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.<br><br>Scripture's authority derives from its divine origin—God has spoken, and His Word carries His authority. This authority is self-attesting—Scripture does not need external validation but validates itself to the regenerate heart through the Spirit's testimony.<br><br>It is supreme—standing above church tradition, human reason, personal experience, and cultural consensus. No pope, council, creed, or experience can override what God has said.<br><br>The Reformation principle of sola Scriptura—Scripture alone as the ultimate authority—remains essential for faithful Christianity."

The man of God is 'perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works' through Scripture.<br><br>The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever—God has revealed what we need to know. His divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness.<br><br>The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple; the statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart. Scripture does not address every question we might ask but provides principles sufficient for every situation.<br><br>We need no new prophecies, visions, or revelations to know God's will. The sufficiency of Scripture protects against adding human traditions as binding requirements and against seeking extra-biblical guidance through subjective impressions.<br><br>It directs us to mine the depths of what God has revealed rather than seeking what He has not disclosed."

        "content": "Scripture's essential message is clear to ordinary readers who approach it seeking to understand and obey—perspicuity does not require scholarly expertise. 'Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.' The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.<br><br>This commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off... the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it. Timothy knew the holy scriptures from childhood—Scripture is accessible to children, not only scholars.<br><br>Clarity does not mean every passage is equally easy to understand—Peter acknowledged that Paul wrote some things hard to understand. It means that the central message of salvation through Christ, the basic requirements of godly living, and the essential doctrines of the faith are sufficiently clear for anyone who reads with humble dependence on the Spirit.<br><br>This clarity liberates believers to read Scripture for themselves, not depending on priestly intermediaries to interpret for them."

        "content": "While Scripture is clear, diligent study is required to rightly understand and apply God's Word. 'Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.' Ezra and the Levites 'read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.' The Ethiopian eunuch needed Philip's help: 'Understandest thou what thou readest?<br><br>How can I, except some man should guide me?' Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. Right interpretation requires: (1) Prayer—asking the Spirit to illuminate; (2) Careful reading—observing what the text actually says; (3) Context—understanding verses within their immediate and broader context; (4) Historical background—knowing the original setting; (5) Grammatical analysis—attending to words, grammar, and genre; (6) Comparing Scripture with Scripture—using clearer passages to interpret less clear; (7) Application—moving from understanding to obedience.<br><br>The goal is not mere knowledge but transformation—that we might be doers of the Word, not hearers only."
