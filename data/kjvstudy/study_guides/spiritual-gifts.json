The Spirit divides to every man severally as He will, so variety is not accident but divine design.<br><br>Because Father, Son, and Spirit are united, diversity must not fracture the body; it reveals the many-sided fullness of Christ. No gift makes one superior, for all depend on the same Giver and all are meant to fit together in the one body.<br><br>Diversity invites gratitude for what others supply, curiosity to understand their contribution, and cooperation rather than competition."

As good stewards of the manifold grace of God, we employ gifts to edify the church, seeking to excel in what builds up the body rather than what elevates self.<br><br>The question is not, What platform do I have? but, Whose burdens am I lifting?"

Giving shares resources freely and quietly, and leadership guides with diligence, not domineering but directing. Mercy moves toward the hurting with tenderness and cheerfulness.<br><br>Each grace must stay within the measure of faith God supplies and be exercised so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ."

Apostles and prophets laid the foundation (Ephesians 2:20); evangelists herald the gospel; pastors and teachers feed and guard through Word and sacrament.<br><br>These Word-centered offices guard against doctrinal waves, unify the church in confession, and train every believer for service so the whole body grows up into Christ. Healthy ministry assumes plurality and accountability in local churches, where shepherds catechize, administer discipline and comfort, and model the Chief Shepherd's care."

These demonstrations of divine power attest the gospel and build up the church, yet they remain subject to Scripture and congregational discernment.<br><br>Claims of extraordinary gifts must be weighed carefully in light of the apostolic foundation, the closed canon, and the Spirit's concern for edification, order, and truth. Where the extraordinary appears claimed, it must submit to the ordinary rule of the Word, the testing of elders, and the aim that the gathered church be instructed rather than dazzled."

They protect from doctrinal instability and enable every part to make increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.<br><br>Maturity means Christlikeness, stability instead of being carried about by every wind, and speaking the truth in love. The Spirit ordinarily grows His church through Word, prayer, and sacrament, using gifts as instruments toward that sober, steady end rather than toward temporary spectacle."

Paul requires intelligibility, interpretation of tongues, regulated prophecy, and mutual submission so that confusion and disorder are avoided.<br><br>Two or three at most may speak in a tongue and only with interpretation; prophets speak by course while others judge. God is not the author of confusion but of peace; worship governed by Scripture, shepherded by elders, and ordered around the means of grace honors the Giver of the gifts and protects His flock."

Every claim of spiritual utterance must be tested against the sufficiency of Scripture, the church's confession, and the fruit it produces.<br><br>The Bereans were noble because they searched the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so; we imitate them by examining teaching, evaluating character, and refusing anything that contradicts the closed canon. True gifts withstand time, testing, and submission to elders; counterfeit zeal demands immediate acceptance and resists accountability."

A man may prophesy or understand mysteries and yet be nothing without love.<br><br>The Spirit's fruit—love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance—authenticates true spirituality and reveals abiding in Christ. Gifts must be yoked to fruit for healthy ministry, for the tree is known by its fruit and not merely by its activity."

We speak as those delivering the oracles of God, aiming that everything done in the gathering be intelligible and edifying.<br><br>The Word furnishes the man of God for every good work, so gifts never bypass or contradict Scripture but serve its ministry. Even spontaneous encouragement or prayer is shaped by Scripture's vocabulary and theology, keeping ministry tethered to the revealed will of God."

The Spirit takes what is Christ's and distributes it to His body, so that every gift ultimately magnifies the triumphant, ascended Lord who fills all things.<br><br>Gifts are not self-originated; they descend from Christ's victory and serve His preeminence. Remembering the Giver keeps us doxological, turning every exercise of gifting into gratitude and every fruit of ministry into praise.<br><br>To use gifts rightly is to abide in the risen Christ, drawing strength from Him and returning glory to Him."

Alongside those extraordinary works, the Spirit gives ordinary, ongoing gifts of word and service for the church's regular life.<br><br>We thank God for all He has done while anchoring our expectations in the ordinary means He promises to bless. The church is healthiest when it prizes faithful preaching, prayer, sacraments, hospitality, mercy, and evangelism, while receiving any unusual providences with gratitude and careful discernment."

No claimed revelation may contradict Scripture, add to the canon, or escape testing.<br><br>False prophecy is serious; therefore the church applies careful, humble scrutiny so that peace and edification, not confusion, mark the assembly. The goal of regulation is not to stifle the Spirit but to ensure the Spirit's own priorities of order, truth, and love guide the gathered church."

Desire must be yoked to humility, prayer for wisdom, and willingness to serve in unseen ways.<br><br>We ask for gifts not to elevate self but to bless Christ's flock and adorn the gospel. Humble seeking includes submitting desires to the church's counsel, being content with the portion God assigns, and rejoicing when others are used more visibly than we are."

Evangelists herald Christ; teachers ground converts; mercy-givers commend the gospel through tangible care; administrators keep the mission coordinated.<br><br>The Spirit's leading in the church at Antioch shows gifts coordinating with fasting, prayer, and the church's commissioning to advance the gospel.

Every joint supplies; all need one another; suffering and honor are shared.<br><br>Interdependence means we slow down to notice missing members, lift those who are weary, and celebrate quiet faithfulness as essential to the church's life."
