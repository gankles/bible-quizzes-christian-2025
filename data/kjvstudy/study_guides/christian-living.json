Unlike the dead sacrifices of the Old Testament, believers offer themselves as living sacrifices—wholly consecrated yet daily functioning in service to God.<br><br>This consecration is reasonable because of God's mercies—the immeasurable grace bestowed through Christ's redemption. Be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.<br><br>The crucified life follows Paul's testimony: 'I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.' Believers are not their own, for they are bought with a price—the precious blood of Christ. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.<br><br>Those who live should no longer live unto themselves but unto Him who died for them and rose again."

Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord.<br><br>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.<br><br>For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. Friendship with the world is enmity with God; whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.<br><br>This separation is not physical isolation but spiritual distinction—maintaining different values, pursuits, and allegiances than the unregenerate world while living as salt and light within it."

They that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.<br><br>For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.<br><br>Walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, redeeming the time because the days are evil. Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled with the Spirit.<br><br>Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth, for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God. Daily yielding to the Spirit's control produces godly living."

Once ye were darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord; walk as children of light, having no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reproving them.<br><br>Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye should shew forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvellous light. Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works glorify God."

This is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication, that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour.<br><br>For God hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness. This holiness is both positional—set apart unto God at conversion—and progressive—growing in practical righteousness throughout life.<br><br>It requires active mortification of sin, deliberate pursuit of righteousness, and continual dependence upon the Spirit's sanctifying work."

Every good gift received demands faithful stewardship.<br><br>As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. The parable of the talents warns against burying our gifts in the earth through laziness or fear.<br><br>Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily as to the Lord and not unto men, knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance, for ye serve the Lord Christ.
