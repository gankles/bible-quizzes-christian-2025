        "content": "The foundational principle of biblical stewardship is that God owns everything—we are merely managers of His resources. 'The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.' The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.<br><br>Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine... Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might.<br><br>Beware lest thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth. But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth.<br><br>This truth demolishes human pride and pretensions to ownership. We brought nothing into this world, and we shall carry nothing out.<br><br>Every possession, every dollar, every opportunity comes from God's hand. We are stewards, not owners—managers accountable to the Master for how we use His resources.<br><br>This perspective transforms financial decisions: we don't ask 'What do I want to do with my money?' but 'What does God want me to do with His money?' It affects spending (Does this honor God?), saving (Am I hoarding or planning wisely?), giving (Am I returning to God what is His?), and earning (Am I using God-given abilities for His glory?). Recognizing God's ownership provides freedom from materialism's grip, for we hold possessions loosely, knowing they're not truly ours.<br><br>It provides motivation for generosity, for we're distributing God's wealth, not our own. It provides accountability, for we will give account to Him for our stewardship."

        "content": "God requires that stewards be found faithful—managing His resources wisely, diligently, and for His glory. 'He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.<br><br>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?' It is required in stewards that a man be found faithful.<br><br>The parable of the talents teaches that God distributes resources variously, expects diligent use, and will require accounting. As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.<br><br>Faithful stewardship encompasses earning, spending, saving, giving, and investing. It means: (1) Working diligently at lawful employment, providing for family and avoiding idleness; (2) Spending wisely on necessary expenses without waste or extravagance; (3) Saving appropriately for future needs and emergencies; (4) Giving generously to God's work and those in need; (5) Avoiding debt that enslaves; (6) Investing resources to produce increase; (7) Planning long-term rather than living merely for today; (8) Using material resources to advance God's kingdom.<br><br>The unfaithful servant who buried his talent represents those who waste opportunities or hoard resources selfishly. The faithful servants who multiplied their talents demonstrate diligent use producing increase.<br><br>God measures faithfulness not by absolute amounts but by diligent use of what we've received. The one-talent servant should have produced proportionate return.<br><br>Faithful stewardship recognizes that we will give account for every resource entrusted to us."

        "content": "Scripture establishes tithing (giving a tenth) as the baseline for giving and encourages generous offerings beyond the tithe. 'Will a man rob God?<br><br>Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee?<br><br>In tithes and offerings. Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.' He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.<br><br>Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over.<br><br>Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. While some debate whether the tithe applies under the new covenant, the principle of proportionate giving from firstfruits remains clear.<br><br>New Testament believers should give at least as generously as Old Testament saints under law. Giving should be: (1) Proportionate—according to income; (2) Systematic—regularly, not sporadically; (3) Prioritized—firstfruits, not leftovers; (4) Cheerful—joyfully, not grudgingly; (5) Generous—beyond minimum requirements; (6) Faith-filled—trusting God's provision.<br><br>Giving blesses both giver and recipient, supports gospel ministry, helps the needy, and demonstrates trust in God's provision. Those who give generously discover that God cannot be outgiven."

        "content": "Godliness with contentment is great gain—finding satisfaction in God's provision rather than constantly craving more. 'Having food and raiment let us be therewith content.<br><br>For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.' Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.<br><br>I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.<br><br>Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain. Contentment is learned through spiritual discipline, not natural inclination.<br><br>It requires: (1) Gratitude—recognizing and thanking God for present blessings; (2) Eternal perspective—valuing spiritual riches above material wealth; (3) Trust—believing God provides what we need; (4) Simplicity—distinguishing needs from wants; (5) Generosity—finding joy in giving rather than accumulating. Discontent breeds covetousness, envy, and constant dissatisfaction.<br><br>The advertising industry thrives on manufacturing discontent, convincing us we need what we lack. Contentment frees from materialism's tyranny, provides peace regardless of circumstances, and demonstrates trust in God's wisdom and provision.<br><br>Paul's secret—doing all things through Christ's strength—indicates contentment is supernatural, wrought by the Spirit, not mere stoicism."

        "content": "Scripture warns strongly against debt, which creates bondage, limits freedom, and presumes upon the future. 'The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.' Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.<br><br>Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts. If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?<br><br>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth. While Scripture doesn't absolutely forbid all debt, it clearly depicts it as dangerous and undesirable.<br><br>Debt enslaves—the borrower becomes servant to the lender, losing freedom to make decisions, change employment, or respond to God's leading. Debt presumes upon tomorrow, assuming future income that may not materialize (James 4:13-15).<br><br>Debt often results from impatience (unwillingness to save) or covetousness (wanting what we cannot afford). Debt can become sin when we borrow without intention or ability to repay, when we borrow for unwise purposes, or when debt prevents fulfilling other obligations (supporting family, giving to God's work).<br><br>The path to financial freedom requires: (1) Avoiding new debt; (2) Eliminating existing debt systematically; (3) Living within means; (4) Saving for purchases rather than borrowing; (5) Planning for emergencies so debt isn't necessary. Exceptions might include home mortgages (if affordable and necessary) or business investments (if calculated and reasonable).<br><br>Credit card debt, consumer debt for depreciating items, and borrowing for lifestyle beyond income are particularly foolish. Freedom from debt provides peace, flexibility, and ability to give generously."

        "content": "Biblical wisdom commends prudent planning and disciplined saving for future needs. 'The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.' Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.<br><br>Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase. Which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?<br><br>Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him. These proverbs commend the ant's industrious preparation, the wisdom of counting costs before beginning projects, and the steady accumulation of wealth through diligent labor.<br><br>Saving demonstrates: (1) Diligence—working and setting aside rather than consuming all; (2) Prudence—preparing for emergencies and known future expenses; (3) Self-control—delaying gratification; (4) Responsibility—providing for family needs; (5) Generosity—having resources to give when opportunities arise. Saving differs from hoarding—the latter involves greed and distrust, while the former involves wisdom and provision.<br><br>Joseph's storing grain during plenty to prepare for famine exemplifies wise planning. Believers should maintain emergency funds (typically 3-6 months expenses), save for known future needs (home maintenance, vehicle replacement, children's education), and plan for retirement (1 Timothy 5:8 requires providing for family, including not burdening them in old age).<br><br>Planning and saving must be balanced with trust in God—we plan wisely while acknowledging that God directs our steps and provides our needs."

Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.' If any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.<br><br>He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.<br><br>Work predates the fall (Adam tended Eden) but became toilsome after sin entered. Still, work remains God's appointed means of provision and an arena for glorifying Him.<br><br>Biblical principles for work include: (1) Diligence—working heartily, not lazily; (2) Honesty—fair dealing, not theft or deception; (3) Excellence—doing quality work as unto the Lord; (4) Purpose—working to provide for family and enable giving, not merely for self-gratification; (5) Balance—working diligently without becoming workaholic; (6) Submission—honoring employers as God's appointed authorities; (7) Witness—demonstrating Christian character in workplace. Refusing to work while able is sin, burdening others unnecessarily.<br><br>Parents who fail to provide for families deny the faith. The diligent worker prospers; the sluggard comes to poverty.<br><br>Yet work must not become idolatry—our ultimate security and provision come from God, not employment. We work as God's stewards, using vocational abilities for His glory and others' good."

        "content": "Jesus commands laying up treasures in heaven rather than on earth, where moth, rust, and thieves destroy. 'For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.' Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.<br><br>Jesus' parable of the rich fool who accumulated wealth but died unprepared warns: 'Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.' James warns that hoarded wealth will testify against those who neglected eternal investment. An eternal perspective recognizes: (1) Material wealth is temporary—we leave it all behind; (2) Spiritual riches are eternal—laying up treasures in heaven; (3) Money is a tool, not a treasure—a means to serve God and others; (4) Generosity produces eternal dividends—investment in souls and kingdom work; (5) Contentment with godliness is greater gain than riches with restlessness; (6) We will give account for our stewardship.<br><br>This perspective frees believers from materialism's deception, motivates strategic generosity, and produces investment in what lasts. Rather than asking 'How much of my money should I give to God?' we should ask 'How much of God's money may I keep for my needs?' The eternal perspective transforms financial decisions, spending priorities, and life goals.<br><br>We cannot serve both God and mammon; we must choose our master. Those who choose God find that He provides abundantly—not necessarily wealth, but sufficiency, contentment, and eternal riches."
