'I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure.' He works all things after the counsel of His own will.<br><br>Christ was delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, demonstrating that even the greatest evil served divine purposes. The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD—nothing is random or outside God's control.<br><br>This decree includes all events great and small, good and evil (though God is never the author of sin), extending to salvation (election), history (providence), and the smallest details of creation. Understanding God's decree provides comfort: nothing happens by chance; all things serve God's purposes.<br><br>It promotes humility: we are creatures dependent upon the Creator's will. It encourages trust: the same God who ordained events will work them for His glory and our good."

'Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.<br><br>He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.' He says to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain and great rain. By Christ all things consist (hold together)—the universe continues moment by moment only by His sustaining power.<br><br>Not one sparrow falls to the ground without your Father's knowledge. There are no 'natural laws' operating independently of God; what we call laws of nature are simply God's regular ways of working.<br><br>Storms, earthquakes, droughts, and floods all serve His purposes. He opens His hand and satisfies the desire of every living thing.<br><br>This truth teaches us that nature worship is idolatry—creation points to the Creator. It teaches that 'accidents' do not exist—God governs all events.<br><br>It provides comfort in natural disasters—God remains sovereign even in catastrophe. We may not understand His purposes, but we can trust His character."

Nebuchadnezzar learned this humbling truth: 'He doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?' The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.<br><br>God hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of nations' habitation. The kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the nations.<br><br>Pharaoh, Cyrus, Nebuchadnezzar, Caesar—all served God's purposes, whether knowingly or unknowingly, willingly or unwillingly. God uses nations to accomplish redemptive history: Egypt for Israel's formation, Assyria and Babylon for judgment, Persia for restoration, Rome for Christ's advent.<br><br>This truth provides perspective on political turmoil—God remains on His throne. It prevents despair over corrupt governments—they too shall pass.<br><br>It warns against nationalism—nations serve God, not vice versa. It encourages prayer for rulers, knowing God can turn hearts."

'All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out...<br><br>And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing.' He saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.<br><br>He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of His will. God saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.<br><br>Election is unconditional—not based on anything in us. It is gracious—we deserve wrath, not mercy.<br><br>It is effectual—those chosen will certainly be saved. It is humbling—we contribute nothing to our salvation.<br><br>It is comforting—our security rests on God's purpose, not our performance."

'Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.<br><br>For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.' Christ was delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, yet taken by wicked hands and crucified—God's decree and human guilt coexist. Joseph told his brothers, 'Ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good'—the same act was simultaneously human sin and divine providence.<br><br>The Son of man goes as it was determined, but woe unto that man by whom He is betrayed—Judas was both fulfilling prophecy and committing culpable sin. Scripture never uses sovereignty to excuse sin or eliminate responsibility.<br><br>God's decree establishes certainty without eliminating human agency. We are not puppets but genuine moral agents whose choices matter, even while God's purposes are always accomplished.<br><br>This mystery should produce worship, not speculation. We preach the gospel to all, knowing God will save His elect.<br><br>We pray earnestly, knowing God ordains both ends and means. We obey diligently, knowing God works in us to will and do."

'We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.' The LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it?<br><br>His hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back? Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?<br><br>Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? Our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.<br><br>Whatever befalls us—sickness, loss, persecution, death—comes only by God's permission and serves His purposes. Nothing can thwart His plans or separate us from His love.<br><br>The same sovereignty that elected us to salvation governs every circumstance of our lives. We need not fear men who can only kill the body; we need not fear circumstances that are all under divine control.<br><br>This truth does not make us passive but active—we work because God works, pray because God ordains means, and trust because God is trustworthy. Sovereignty is not fatalism but faith—resting in a God who is too wise to err and too good to be unkind."
