Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding.<br><br>This fear is not terror or dread but reverential awe, profound respect, and loving submission to God's authority. It recognizes God's sovereignty, acknowledges His holiness, trembles at His word, and desires to please Him above all else.<br><br>True wisdom begins here because until one rightly relates to God—the source of all truth—no genuine wisdom is possible. Worldly knowledge divorced from godly fear produces clever fools.<br><br>Divine wisdom begins with knowing and honoring the Lord."

For the LORD giveth wisdom; out of His mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.<br><br>When Solomon asked for an understanding heart to judge God's people and discern between good and bad, God granted his request and gave him wisdom exceeding all others. Daniel blessed God, saying, Wisdom and might are His; He giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that know understanding.<br><br>God delights to grant wisdom to those who humbly seek it, ask in faith, and intend to use it for His glory and others' good."

For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than your thoughts.<br><br>Human wisdom, corrupted by sin and limited by finite understanding, proves utterly insufficient for life's navigation. God's wisdom infinitely transcends human reasoning.<br><br>Therefore believers must trust God's revealed truth above their own perceptions, submit to His guidance rather than their own plans, and acknowledge Him in all decisions. Such trust brings divine direction and protection from the disasters that follow self-directed living."
