        "content": "Scripture makes the astounding declaration that 'God is love'—not merely that He loves, but that love constitutes His essential nature and character. He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love.<br><br>We have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.<br><br>This love is not sentiment or emotion but the very essence of the divine being. When God revealed Himself to Moses, He proclaimed His character: 'The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.' The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.<br><br>Every attribute of God—His sovereignty, holiness, justice, and power—operates in perfect harmony with His love. Understanding that God is love transforms our view of creation, providence, redemption, and eternity."

He made the heavens, the earth, the sun, moon, and stars in wisdom—His love demonstrated in creation's order and beauty.<br><br>Though past generations walked in their own ways, yet He left not Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness. God makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust—common grace flowing from divine benevolence.<br><br>The LORD is good to all, and His tender mercies are over all His works. The very existence and sustenance of creation testifies to God's loving character, providing abundant evidence of His goodness even to those who reject Him."

This love is not based on Israel's merit—'The LORD did not set His love upon you nor choose you because ye were more in number than any people, for ye were the fewest of all people.' Rather, it flows from His sovereign will and covenant faithfulness.<br><br>When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love.<br><br>God's love persists despite human unfaithfulness. It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not.<br><br>They are new every morning; great is Thy faithfulness. This covenant love, the Hebrew hesed, combines loyal affection with committed action—God binds Himself to His people and never forsakes them."

For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.<br><br>God commendeth His love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might live through Him.<br><br>Herein is love, not that we loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ.<br><br>This love is not response to human worthiness but sovereign initiative toward the undeserving. The infinite cost—God's beloved Son suffering and dying—measures love's magnitude.<br><br>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."

The mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him, and His righteousness unto children's children.<br><br>Though the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed, yet My kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of My peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee. Having loved His own which were in the world, He loved them unto the end.<br><br>This love is not fickle or conditional but eternal and immutable, grounded in God's unchanging character rather than human performance."

Paul prayed that believers, being rooted and grounded in love, might be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height, and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.<br><br>Though it surpasses knowledge, it may be known through experience. The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us—the Spirit makes divine love a living reality in believers' experience.<br><br>Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God! The wonder of God's adopting love should move us to amazement and worship.<br><br>Whoso is wise and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD. Meditation on Scripture, Spirit-illumination, and practical experience of God's faithfulness deepen our comprehension of His love."

For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments, and His commandments are not grievous.<br><br>The love of Christ constraineth us, having concluded that if one died for all, then were all dead, and that He died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto Him which died for them and rose again. Proper response to divine love includes grateful worship, trusting obedience, sacrificial service, and passionate witness.<br><br>Those who truly comprehend God's love cannot remain passive or indifferent but are compelled to reciprocate through devoted living."

Be ye therefore followers of God as dear children, and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us and hath given Himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God.<br><br>This love extends even to enemies: 'Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you, that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven.' God's love, received and experienced, must flow through believers to others.
