        "description": "The foundational truth of biblical monotheism declares that there is one and only one God. This is the Shema of Israel, the creed recited daily by devout Jews: 'Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD.' Yet this unity is not mere mathematical singularity but a rich, complex unity—the Hebrew word 'echad' can denote a composite unity (as in 'one flesh' of husband and wife). The New Testament affirms this monotheism while revealing that within the one divine essence exist three distinct persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—each fully and equally God, yet not three Gods but one. This mystery transcends human comprehension yet is consistently revealed throughout Scripture.",

        "description": "While affirming one God, Scripture clearly distinguishes three persons within the Godhead. The Father is not the Son, the Son is not the Spirit, and the Spirit is not the Father—yet each is fully God. These distinctions are not modes or manifestations that God assumes at different times (modalism), nor are they three separate beings (tritheism). Rather, they are eternal, personal distinctions within the one divine being. The Father eternally begets the Son, the Spirit eternally proceeds from the Father (and the Son, in Western theology), yet none is before or after another in time or dignity. This tri-personal existence is essential to God's nature as love—for love requires an object, and God has loved within Himself from all eternity.",

God speaks of Himself in the plural ('Let us make man in our image'), the Angel of the LORD appears as God Himself yet distinct from God, and the Spirit of God operates distinctly from YHWH. The Shema's use of 'echad' (composite unity) rather than 'yachid' (absolute singularity) allows for this plurality.

        "description": "The Holy Spirit is not a lesser deity or created being but fully God, co-equal and co-eternal with the Father and Son. Scripture directly identifies Him as God (Acts 5:3-4), attributes divine perfections to Him (omnipresence, omniscience, eternality), credits Him with divine works (creation, inspiration, regeneration), and places Him alongside the Father and Son in the Trinitarian formula. Blaspheming the Spirit is the unforgivable sin—not because the Spirit is greater than the Father or Son, but because rejecting His testimony to Christ leaves no avenue for forgiveness. The Spirit is the Lord, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.",

The Spirit is sent by both Father and Son in the economy of redemption, reflecting this eternal procession.
