He was not born of natural generation, inheriting Adam's sin, but was holy from conception. Matthew explicitly cites Isaiah's prophecy as fulfilled in Jesus' birth.

The stone cut without hands struck the image and became a great mountain filling the earth—the kingdom of God crushing all earthly kingdoms. Gabriel announced to Mary that God would give Jesus the throne of His father David, and of His kingdom there shall be no end. Christ's kingdom is not of this world, yet it conquers all worldly powers and endures eternally.",
