    "description": "Giving freely and liberally as stewards of God's blessings",
    "overview": "<p class=\"intro-text\"><span class=\"newthought\">Biblical generosity</span> begins with recognizing God's ownership of all things. \"The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof\" (Psalms 24:1). We are stewards, not owners—managers of resources that belong to another. This perspective transforms giving from reluctant obligation to joyful privilege.</p>\n\n<p class=\"intro-text\">God's generosity sets the standard for ours. \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son\" (John 3:16). The Father gave His best; the Son gave His life. Such lavish divine giving calls forth proportionate human response. \"Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich\" (2 Corinthians 8:9).</p>\n\n<p class=\"intro-text\">Scripture promises that generosity produces blessing. \"Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over\" (Luke 6:38). This is not prosperity gospel but divine principle: those who sow bountifully reap bountifully. God entrusts more to those who prove faithful in giving, not to enrich them but to expand their capacity for generosity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"intro-text\">The heart matters more than the amount. The widow's two mites exceeded the rich men's offerings because \"she of her want did cast in all that she had\" (Mark 12:44). God measures giving by sacrifice, not sum. Cheerful, willing, sacrificial giving honors God regardless of the dollar amount.</p>",
