    "description": "The ordinance signifying identification with Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection",
    "overview": "<p class=\"intro-text\"><span class=\"newthought\">Baptism marks</span> the public beginning of the Christian life. From the Greek <em>baptizo</em> (to immerse, submerge), this ordinance pictures spiritual reality through physical action. When believers go under the water, they identify with Christ's death and burial; when they emerge, they proclaim His resurrection and their new life in Him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"intro-text\">Scripture presents baptism as the normal response to saving faith. \"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ\" (Acts 2:38). Throughout Acts, new believers were baptized immediately upon profession of faith—the Ethiopian eunuch, the Philippian jailer, Lydia, and thousands at Pentecost. Baptism follows faith; it does not produce it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"intro-text\">The meaning of baptism encompasses multiple truths. It symbolizes <strong>union with Christ</strong>: \"buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him\" (Colossians 2:12). It signifies <strong>cleansing from sin</strong>, though not as the cause but as the picture: \"the washing of regeneration\" (Titus 3:5). It represents <strong>entrance into the visible church</strong>, publicly identifying with Christ's body.</p>\n\n<p class=\"intro-text\">Jesus Himself was baptized, not for His own sins but to \"fulfil all righteousness\" (Matthew 3:15). His baptism inaugurated His public ministry and received divine approval: \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\" Believers follow their Lord's example, obeying His command: \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\" (Matthew 28:19).</p>",
