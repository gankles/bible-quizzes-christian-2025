    "overview": "<p class=\"intro-text\"><span class=\"newthought\">Biblical wisdom</span> differs fundamentally from worldly intelligence. While the world prizes clever strategy and self-advancement, Scripture defines wisdom as \"the fear of the LORD\" (Proverbs 9:10). This wisdom begins with right relationship to God and produces right living before men.</p>\n\n<p class=\"intro-text\">Wisdom is personified in Proverbs, calling out in the streets: \"How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity?\" (Proverbs 1:22). This literary device emphasizes wisdom's availability and urgency. She offers life to those who find her: \"Whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD\" (Proverbs 8:35). Christ Himself is \"the wisdom of God\" (1 Corinthians 1:24), the ultimate revelation of divine truth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"intro-text\">James distinguishes two kinds of wisdom. Earthly wisdom is \"sensual, devilish\" and produces \"envying and strife\" (James 3:14-15). But \"the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits\" (James 3:17). The source determines the character—wisdom from below serves self; wisdom from above serves God and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"intro-text\">God promises wisdom to those who ask. \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him\" (James 1:5). This liberality encourages persistent prayer for discernment. Solomon asked for wisdom above all else and received not only wisdom but riches and honor as well (1 Kings 3:9-13).</p>",
