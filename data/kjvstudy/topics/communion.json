    "description": "The Lord's Supper commemorating Christ's sacrifice and anticipating His return",
    "overview": "<p class=\"intro-text\"><span class=\"newthought\">The Lord's Supper</span> stands as the church's central act of worship and remembrance. Instituted by Christ on the night before His crucifixion, this meal proclaims His death until He comes again. \"This do in remembrance of me\" (Luke 22:19) commands believers to perpetuate this sacred meal throughout church history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"intro-text\">The elements carry profound meaning. The <strong>bread</strong> represents Christ's body, broken for our redemption: \"This is my body which is given for you\" (Luke 22:19). The <strong>cup</strong> signifies His blood, poured out for sin's forgiveness: \"This cup is the new testament in my blood\" (Luke 22:20). Together they proclaim the gospel in visible form—Christ's atoning death securing eternal life for all who believe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"intro-text\">Communion is both backward-looking and forward-looking. It <strong>remembers</strong> Calvary: \"as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death\" (1 Corinthians 11:26). It also <strong>anticipates</strong> Christ's return: \"till he come.\" The church celebrates between the cross and the crown, between redemption accomplished and redemption consummated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"intro-text\">Scripture calls for serious self-examination before partaking. \"Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup\" (1 Corinthians 11:28). Those who eat and drink unworthily bring judgment upon themselves. The table calls for confession, reconciliation, and renewed commitment. This solemn joy marks the communion of saints with their Lord and with one another.</p>",
