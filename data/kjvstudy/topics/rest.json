    "description": "Ceasing from labor to worship God and restore the soul",
    "overview": "<p class=\"intro-text\"><span class=\"newthought\">Rest is</span> not laziness but obedience. God rested on the seventh day—not from exhaustion but from completion. \"And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work\" (Genesis 2:3). This divine pattern establishes rest as sacred, built into creation's rhythm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"intro-text\">The Sabbath command protected workers and pointed to greater rest. \"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy\" (Exodus 20:8). Israel's weekly rest testified that life depends on God, not endless labor. The sabbath was gift, not burden: \"The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath\" (Mark 2:27).</p>\n\n<p class=\"intro-text\">Christ offers rest for weary souls. \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls\" (Matthew 11:28-29). This rest comes not from ceasing activity but from ceasing self-effort—resting in Christ's finished work rather than our own striving.</p>\n\n<p class=\"intro-text\">Hebrews speaks of \"a rest to the people of God\" (Hebrews 4:9)—the ultimate sabbath of eternal fellowship with God. Present rest in Christ anticipates future rest in glory. \"There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his\" (Hebrews 4:9-10). Christians labor to enter that rest through faith, not works.</p>",
