      "narrative": "John, the beloved disciple, had grown old. Banished to the rocky island of Patmos for preaching the Word of God and testifying about Jesus, he found himself alone on the Lord's Day when suddenly he heard a voice like a trumpet behind him: 'Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches.'\n\nJohn turned to see who spoke. What he saw made him fall at the speaker's feet as though dead. There, among seven golden lampstands, stood one like a son of man, clothed in a long robe with a golden sash across His chest. His head and hair were white as snow, pure as wool. His eyes blazed like flames of fire, seeing all, piercing through every pretense. His feet gleamed like polished bronze refined in a furnace, and His voice thundered like rushing waters.\n\nIn His right hand He held seven stars, and from His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword. His face shone like the sun in full strength—unbearable, unapproachable glory. This was no gentle carpenter from Nazareth, no suffering servant on a cross. This was the risen, glorified, conquering Christ, the Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last.\n\nYet when He placed His right hand on trembling John, His voice carried familiar gentleness: 'Fear not. I am the first and the last, and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades.'\n\nJesus explained the vision: the seven lampstands were the seven churches, and the seven stars were their angels or messengers. Christ walked among His churches, knowing their deeds, their struggles, their faithfulness and failures. Though John was exiled and the churches faced persecution, Jesus remained sovereign, present, powerful.\n\nThis vision set the tone for all that would follow. Whatever tribulations, judgments, and cosmic battles John would witness, one truth anchored everything: Jesus Christ reigns victorious over death itself.",

When John was very old, some mean people sent him away to a lonely island called Patmos because he kept talking about Jesus.\n\nOne Sunday, John heard a super loud voice like a trumpet behind him! 'Write down what you see!' the voice said.\n\nJohn turned around and—WOW! He saw someone who looked so amazing and bright! It was Jesus, but He looked different than before. Jesus' hair was white as snow, and His eyes were bright like fire. His face shined brighter than the sun! He wore a long, beautiful robe with a golden belt.\n\nJohn was so amazed and a little scared that he fell down on the ground.\n\nBut Jesus reached down and touched John gently. 'Don't be afraid, John,' Jesus said in a kind voice. 'I am the First and the Last. I was dead, but look—I am alive forever and ever! And I have the keys to everything, even death.'\n\nJesus told John to write down messages for seven churches. Even though John was far away on an island, Jesus was still watching over all His churches and taking care of His people.\n\nThis made John feel so much better! Jesus is alive and powerful! He takes care of everyone who loves Him."

      "themes": ["Faithfulness", "Perseverance", "Repentance", "Overcoming"],
      "characters": ["Jesus Christ", "The seven churches"],
      "narrative": "One by one, Jesus dictated messages to the seven churches, each one uniquely crafted to address their specific situations, yet all carrying timeless truths for believers everywhere.\n\nTo Ephesus, He commended their hard work and discernment but rebuked them: 'You have abandoned the love you had at first.' To Smyrna, facing persecution and poverty, He offered only encouragement: 'Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.' To Pergamum, holding fast in Satan's throne room, He warned against tolerating false teaching. To Thyatira, He praised their growing love and service but condemned their acceptance of a false prophetess leading people into immorality.\n\nTo Sardis came the sobering words: 'You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead.' Wake up and strengthen what remains. To Philadelphia, the church with little power but great faithfulness, Jesus promised, 'I have set before you an open door.' And to Laodicea, neither hot nor cold, came the strongest rebuke: 'Because you are lukewarm, I will spit you out of my mouth.' They thought themselves rich and prosperous, but Christ saw them as wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked.\n\nYet even to Laodicea came an invitation: 'Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.'\n\nEach letter ended with a promise to the one who overcomes—they would eat from the tree of life, receive the crown of life, be given hidden manna and a white stone, have authority over the nations, be clothed in white garments, become pillars in God's temple, and sit with Christ on His throne.\n\nThese churches were real congregations facing real struggles—persecution, poverty, false teaching, compromise, spiritual deadness, and lukewarmness. The letters reveal Christ's intimate knowledge of His bride, His intolerance of sin mixed with His desire for repentance, and His promise that faithful endurance will be rewarded beyond measure.",

      "kids_narrative": "After John saw Jesus, Jesus gave him important messages to write down for seven different churches—like seven different groups of God's people.\n\nTo some churches, Jesus said, 'Good job! You're working hard and staying faithful even when it's hard. I'm proud of you!' One church was going through tough times, but Jesus said, 'Keep being brave! I will give you a special crown!'\n\nTo other churches, Jesus said, 'I love you, but you need to do better.' One church had forgotten to love Jesus like they used to. Another church was letting people teach wrong things about God. One church looked good on the outside but wasn't really loving Jesus on the inside.\n\nOne church thought they were rich and didn't need anything. But Jesus said, 'You actually need Me! I'm knocking on your door. Will you let Me in?'\n\nTo every church, Jesus made special promises. He said if they kept following Him and didn't give up, He would give them wonderful rewards in heaven! They would get to eat special food, wear beautiful white clothes, and sit with Jesus on His throne!\n\nThese messages weren't just for those churches long ago. They're for us too! Jesus wants us to love Him with all our hearts, tell the truth about Him, and never give up—even when it's hard. And He promises to reward everyone who stays faithful to Him!"

At once, John was in the Spirit.\n\nBefore him blazed a throne, and One seated on it gleaming like jasper and carnelian. A rainbow, emerald green, encircled the throne. Around it sat twenty-four elders clothed in white garments with golden crowns on their heads. From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings, and peals of thunder. Seven torches of fire burned before it—the seven spirits of God. Before the throne stretched something like a sea of glass, clear as crystal.\n\nAround the throne were four living creatures, covered with eyes in front and behind—one like a lion, one like an ox, one with the face of a man, and one like a flying eagle. Day and night they never ceased to say, 'Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!' And whenever they gave glory to Him who sits on the throne, the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped, casting their crowns before the throne and saying, 'Worthy are You, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for You created all things, and by Your will they existed and were created.'\n\nThen John saw a scroll in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne, sealed with seven seals. A mighty angel proclaimed, 'Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?' But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open it or even look into it. John began to weep loudly—until one of the elders said, 'Weep no more. The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that He can open the scroll.'\n\nJohn looked and saw a Lamb standing as though it had been slain, with seven horns and seven eyes. He took the scroll, and when He did, the four living creatures and twenty-four elders fell down before Him, each holding a harp and golden bowls of incense—the prayers of the saints. They sang a new song: 'Worthy are You to take the scroll and to open its seals, for You were slain, and by Your blood You ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.'\n\nThen John heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea—everything that exists—saying, 'To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!' The living creatures said, 'Amen!' and the elders fell down and worshiped.\n\nHere was the heart of all reality: the holy God on His throne, the Lamb who was slain standing victorious, and all creation giving Him endless praise. Whatever judgments and trials would follow, this scene anchored everything—God reigns, Christ has conquered, and He alone is worthy.",

It sparkled like jewels, and a rainbow circled all around it like a giant halo. Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled from the throne.\n\nAround the throne sat twenty-four important people called elders, all wearing white clothes and golden crowns. There were also four special creatures covered with eyes—one looked like a lion, one like a cow, one like a person, and one like an eagle.\n\nThese creatures sang all day and all night: 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God!' And when they sang, the elders fell down and put their crowns in front of God's throne. 'You made everything!' they said. 'You deserve all the praise!'\n\nThen John saw God holding a scroll—a special book rolled up and sealed with seven seals. An angel called out, 'Who is good enough to open this special scroll?'\n\nBut nobody could open it! Not anyone in heaven or on earth. John started to cry because nobody was worthy.\n\nBut then an elder said, 'Don't cry! The Lion of Judah has won! He can open it!'\n\nJohn looked and saw a Lamb—it was Jesus! Even though He had been hurt, He was standing strong. Jesus took the scroll, and everyone fell down and worshiped Him!\n\nThey sang, 'You are worthy, Jesus! You died for us and saved people from everywhere!' Soon, every creature everywhere was singing praise to God and to Jesus the Lamb!\n\nHeaven is full of worship and praise for God and Jesus.

      "narrative": "As the Lamb opened the first seal, one of the four living creatures thundered, 'Come!' A white horse appeared, its rider holding a bow and wearing a crown, going out conquering and to conquer. The second seal brought a rider on a red horse, taking peace from the earth so that people would slaughter one another. The third seal revealed a black horse, its rider holding scales—famine and economic devastation. The fourth seal loosed a pale horse, its rider named Death, followed by Hades, given authority to kill with sword, famine, pestilence, and wild beasts.\n\nWhen the fifth seal was opened, John saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the Word of God and their testimony. They cried out with a loud voice, 'O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before You will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?' They were given white robes and told to rest a little longer until the number of their fellow servants and brothers should be complete.\n\nThe sixth seal brought cosmic upheaval—a great earthquake, the sun becoming black as sackcloth, the full moon like blood, stars falling from the sky, the sky vanishing like a scroll, and every mountain and island removed from its place. Kings, generals, the rich, the powerful, and everyone else hid in caves and among rocks, crying to the mountains, 'Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, for the great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand?'\n\nBut before the next judgment fell, four angels held back the winds of the earth while another angel sealed the servants of God on their foreheads—144,000 from all the tribes of Israel. Then John saw a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation and tribe and people and language, standing before the throne in white robes with palm branches, crying out, 'Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!'\n\nAn elder asked John, 'Who are these?' John replied, 'Sir, you know.' And the elder said, 'These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore they are before the throne of God and serve Him day and night. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes.'\n\nWhen the seventh seal was opened, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour—the calm before the trumpet judgments. An angel took a golden censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it on the earth. There were peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake. The prayers of the saints had ascended before God, and judgment was coming.",

Each time He opened a seal, John saw something happen on earth.\n\nFirst, a rider on a white horse came out—conquering things. Then a red horse came out, bringing fighting and war. A black horse brought hunger and not enough food. A pale horse brought sickness and death. These were hard, sad things.\n\nBut then Jesus opened the fifth seal, and John saw something different. He saw people in heaven—God's people who had been hurt for loving Jesus. They asked God, 'When will You make everything right?' God gave them beautiful white robes and told them to rest a little while longer.\n\nWhen the sixth seal opened, big earthquakes shook the earth, the sun turned dark, and the moon looked red like blood. Everyone was scared and tried to hide. They knew God was going to judge the bad things people had done.\n\nBut wait! Before more hard things happened, God sent an angel to put a special mark on His people's foreheads—like an invisible protective seal. This meant God knew who belonged to Him and would keep them safe!\n\nThen John saw a huge crowd in heaven—so many people he couldn't count them all! They came from every country and spoke every language. They were all wearing white robes and holding palm branches. They shouted, 'God saved us!'\n\nSomeone told John, 'These people went through really hard times. But Jesus saved them, and now God will take care of them forever. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes.'\n\nEven when hard things happen, God takes care of His people!"

These two witnesses were described as the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. If anyone tried to harm them, fire would pour from their mouths and consume their foes. They had power to shut the sky so that no rain would fall, to turn waters into blood, and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they desired.\n\nFor three and a half years they prophesied, calling the world to repentance, confronting the powers of darkness with the truth of God. The inhabitants of the earth, loving their sin, hated them. But no one could silence them—until their testimony was complete.\n\nWhen they finished their testimony, the beast that rises from the bottomless pit made war on them, conquered them, and killed them. Their dead bodies lay in the street of the great city—symbolically called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified. For three and a half days, people from every nation gazed at their dead bodies and refused them burial. The inhabitants of the earth rejoiced over them, celebrating and exchanging presents, because these two prophets had tormented those who dwell on the earth.\n\nBut after the three and a half days, a breath of life from God entered them. They stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. Then a loud voice from heaven called, 'Come up here!' And they went up to heaven in a cloud while their enemies watched.\n\nAt that moment, a great earthquake struck, and a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.\n\nThe two witnesses represented the church's testimony during times of persecution—seemingly defeated, apparently overcome, but ultimately vindicated by the God who raises the dead. Their resurrection was a preview of the final resurrection, when all God's faithful witnesses would be raised and rewarded.",

They were like superheroes for God!\n\nThe prophets told people, 'Stop doing bad things! Turn back to God!' But most people didn't listen. They didn't like hearing the truth. They wished the prophets would just go away.\n\nFinally, a bad beast from a dark pit came and killed the two prophets. Their bodies lay in the street, and people were actually happy! They had parties because the prophets who told them the truth were gone. How sad!\n\nFor three and a half days, the prophets' bodies just lay there.

The dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, ready to devour her child as soon as it was born.\n\nShe gave birth to a male child, one who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron. But her child was caught up to God and to His throne—a reference to Christ's ascension and ultimate victory. The woman fled into the wilderness, where God had prepared a place for her to be nourished for 1,260 days.\n\nWar broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back, but they were defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. The great dragon was thrown down—that ancient serpent called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world.

But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!'\n\nWhen the dragon saw that he had been thrown to earth, he pursued the woman.

The beast resembled a leopard but had feet like a bear's and a mouth like a lion's. The dragon gave it his power, his throne, and great authority.\n\nOne of the beast's heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed. The whole earth marveled and followed the beast, worshiping the dragon who had given authority to the beast, and worshiping the beast, saying, 'Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?'\n\nThe beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months. It opened its mouth to blaspheme God, blaspheming His name and His dwelling, and it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them. Authority was given it over every tribe, people, language, and nation, and all who dwell on earth would worship it—everyone whose name had not been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain.\n\n'Let anyone who has ears to hear, listen,' John wrote. 'If anyone is to be taken captive, to captivity he goes; if anyone is to be slain with the sword, with the sword must he be slain. Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints.'\n\nThen another beast rose out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb but spoke like a dragon. It exercised all the authority of the first beast and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast. It performed great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people. By the signs it was allowed to work, it deceived those who dwell on earth, telling them to make an image for the beast that was wounded by the sword and yet lived.\n\nIt was allowed to give breath to the image so that the image could even speak and cause those who would not worship it to be slain. It forced all people—small and great, rich and poor, free and slave—to receive a mark on their right hand or forehead. No one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of its name.\n\n'This calls for wisdom,' John wrote. 'Let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.'\n\nThis vision revealed the ultimate choice: worship the beast and take its mark, receiving temporary security but eternal judgment, or refuse the mark, facing persecution and death but receiving eternal life through faithfulness to the Lamb.",

It made people get a special mark on their hand or forehead—like an invisible tattoo. The mark was the number 666.\n\nIf you had the mark, you could buy food and things at the store. But if you didn't have the mark, you couldn't buy anything! The beast was trying to force everyone to worship it.\n\nBut some brave people said, 'NO! We will ONLY worship God and Jesus! We won't take the mark, even if it's hard.' These were God's people, and they stayed faithful even when bad things happened to them.\n\nGod saw how brave they were. He knew who loved Him and who didn't. The beasts seemed powerful, but they weren't more powerful than God! God's people trusted that Jesus would take care of them in the end.\n\nThis story teaches us to worship only God, no matter what!"

      "narrative": "One of the seven angels showed John a great prostitute seated on many waters—the great city that has dominion over the kings of the earth. She was clothed in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold, jewels, and pearls, holding a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality. On her forehead was written a name of mystery: 'Babylon the Great, mother of prostitutes and of earth's abominations.' She was drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.\n\nThe angel explained that the woman represented a great city that rides on the beast—temporarily aligned with evil powers but ultimately to be destroyed by them. Her name, Babylon, evoked the ancient city that opposed God and persecuted His people. She symbolized worldly systems built on pride, materialism, and persecution of believers.\n\nThen another angel came down from heaven with great authority, and the earth was made bright with his glory. He called out with a mighty voice: 'Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great! She has become a dwelling place for demons, a haunt for every unclean spirit and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxurious living.'\n\nAnother voice from heaven said, 'Come out of her, my people, lest you take part in her sins and share in her plagues; for her sins are heaped high as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.'\n\nIn a single day her plagues would come—death, mourning, and famine—and she would be burned up with fire. The kings who committed immorality with her wept and wailed when they saw the smoke of her burning. The merchants mourned because no one bought their cargo anymore—gold, silver, jewels, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet cloth, spices, wine, oil, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots, and human slaves and souls.\n\nBut a mighty angel took up a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, 'So will Babylon the great city be thrown down with violence, and will be found no more. The sound of harpists and musicians, of flute players and trumpeters, will be heard in you no more. No craftsman of any craft will be found in you anymore, and the sound of the mill will be heard in you no more. The light of a lamp will shine in you no more, and the voice of bridegroom and bride will be heard in you no more, for your merchants were the great ones of the earth, and all nations were deceived by your sorcery. And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all who have been slain on earth.'\n\nAfter this, John heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying out, 'Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, for His judgments are true and just; He has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her immorality, and has avenged on her the blood of His servants.'\n\nThe fall of Babylon represented God's final judgment on all systems of oppression, materialism, and rebellion against Him. It was a call to God's people to remain separate from worldly corruption and to trust that God would ultimately vindicate His name and reward faithfulness.",

      "kids_narrative": "John saw a big, fancy city called Babylon. It had expensive clothes, gold, jewels, and lots of stuff! But even though it looked pretty on the outside, it was really bad on the inside.\n\nThis city was mean to God's people. It was proud and selfish and only cared about money and things. It didn't care about God at all. It hurt people who loved Jesus.\n\nThen an angel came down from heaven, shining really bright, and shouted in a loud voice: 'Babylon has fallen! The bad city is going down!'\n\nAnother voice from heaven called to God's people, 'Come out of that bad city! Don't be part of what they're doing! Run away from there so you don't get in trouble too!'\n\nThen, in just ONE day, terrible things happened to the city. Kings and rich people who bought and sold fancy things started crying. 'Oh no!' they said. 'All the pretty things and money are gone!'\n\nAn angel picked up a HUGE stone—as big as a grinding mill—and threw it into the ocean. SPLASH! 'That's how Babylon will be thrown down!' the angel said. 'It will disappear and never be found again. No more music, no more parties, no more lights—it will all be gone!'\n\nWhy did this happen? Because the city had hurt God's people and was so proud and mean.\n\nBut up in heaven, everyone was HAPPY! They sang, 'Hallelujah! Praise God! He is fair and right! He judged the bad city and stood up for His people!'\n\nThis teaches us not to love money and stuff more than God. We should love God and be kind to others!"

      "characters": ["Jesus Christ", "The armies of heaven", "The beast", "The false prophet", "Kings of the earth"],
      "narrative": "Then John saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many diadems. He had a name written that no one knows but Himself. He was clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which He is called is The Word of God.\n\nThe armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, followed Him on white horses. From His mouth came a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. On His robe and on His thigh He had a name written: King of Kings and Lord of Lords.\n\nThis was not the gentle carpenter who wept over Jerusalem, nor the suffering servant who went like a lamb to the slaughter. This was the conquering King, returning to claim what is rightfully His and to execute judgment on His enemies.\n\nAn angel standing in the sun called with a loud voice to all the birds flying directly overhead, 'Come, gather for the great supper of God, to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great.'\n\nThe beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against Him who was sitting on the horse and against His army. It was the ultimate rebellion—finite creatures thinking they could war against their infinite Creator. But the battle was no contest.\n\nThe beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur. The rest were slain by the sword that came from the mouth of Him who was sitting on the horse, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh.\n\nThe image was stark and sobering. Christ's return would not be to negotiate or compromise but to conquer. Those who had rejected Him, persecuted His people, and worshiped the beast would face judgment. The victory won spiritually at Calvary would be manifested physically and visibly when Christ returned in glory.\n\nFor believers, this vision brought hope: their suffering was temporary, their vindication certain. Christ would return, and every knee would bow. For unbelievers, it was a final warning: there is still time to repent, but when Christ returns as conquering King, the time for mercy will have passed.",

His robe was red, and He had a special name written on it: 'King of Kings and Lord of Lords!'\n\nBehind Jesus came a huge army from heaven, all riding white horses too! They wore clean, white clothes. Jesus was leading them to win the big final battle.\n\nDown on earth, the bad beast and all the kings who followed him got their armies together. They actually thought they could fight against Jesus! How silly! Nobody can beat Jesus!\n\nThe beast and the false prophet who did magic tricks were captured right away. They were thrown into a lake of fire—a place of punishment forever.\n\nJesus won the battle SO easily! He is way more powerful than any bad guy. He didn't even have to try hard. Jesus is the KING over everything and everyone!\n\nAll the angels in heaven were so happy! They knew Jesus would win. They had been waiting for this moment!\n\nOne day, this will really happen. Jesus will come back riding on a cloud, and everyone will see Him! All the people who love Jesus will be so happy. Jesus will defeat all the bad things forever.\n\nAre you ready for Jesus to come back? If you love Him and follow Him, you'll be part of His victory celebration!"

      "narrative": "Then John saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. The old order of things—marked by sin, death, and decay—had vanished, replaced by something entirely new.\n\nHe saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. This was no earthly city but a perfect dwelling place for God and His people.\n\nA loud voice from the throne proclaimed, 'Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.'\n\nThis was the fulfillment of all God's promises from the beginning. In Eden, God walked with man. Sin brought separation. But now, through Christ, the separation was forever ended. God would dwell with His people eternally.\n\nThe One seated on the throne said, 'Behold, I am making all things new.' Then He said, 'Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true. It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment. The one who conquers will have this heritage, and I will be his God and he will be My son.'\n\nAn angel carried John away in the Spirit to a great, high mountain and showed him the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God, its radiance like a most rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels. The names of the twelve tribes of Israel were inscribed on the gates. The wall had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.\n\nThe city was pure gold, like clear glass. Its foundations were adorned with every kind of jewel—jasper, sapphire, agate, emerald, onyx, carnelian, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysoprase, jacinth, and amethyst. The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each made from a single pearl. The street of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass.\n\nJohn saw no temple in the city, for its temple was the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. The city had no need of sun or moon, for the glory of God gave it light, and its lamp was the Lamb. The nations would walk by its light, and the kings of the earth would bring their glory into it. Its gates would never be shut by day—and there would be no night there. Nothing unclean would ever enter it, nor anyone who did what was detestable or false, but only those written in the Lamb's book of life.\n\nThen the angel showed John the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city. On either side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.\n\nNo longer would there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb would be in it, and His servants would worship Him. They would see His face, and His name would be on their foreheads. Night would be no more. They would need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God would be their light, and they would reign forever and ever.\n\nJesus said, 'Behold, I am coming soon. Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.' He declared, 'I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.'\n\nThe Spirit and the Bride say, 'Come.' Let the one who hears say, 'Come.' Let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life without price.\n\nJesus testified, 'Surely I am coming soon.'\n\nJohn responded with the prayer that has echoed through every generation of believers: 'Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!'\n\nThe grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.",
