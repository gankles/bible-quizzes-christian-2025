      "narrative": "Joshua sent two spies to view the land, especially Jericho. They entered the city and came to the house of a prostitute named Rahab, where they stayed.\n\nWord reached the king of Jericho: 'Israelite spies have come!' He sent orders to Rahab: 'Bring out the men who came to you. They are spies.'\n\nBut Rahab had hidden the men on her roof under stalks of flax. 'Yes, men came to me,' she told the king's messengers, 'but I didn't know where they were from. They left at dusk, before the gate closed. Hurry after them!' The pursuers headed toward the Jordan fords.\n\nBefore the spies settled down for the night, Rahab went up to them on the roof. 'I know the Lord has given you this land,' she said. 'All who live here are melting in fear because of you. We have heard how the Lord dried up the Red Sea when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two Amorite kings. When we heard it, our hearts melted. The Lord your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below.\n\n'Now then, please swear to me by the Lord that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters.'\n\n'Our lives for your lives!' the men assured her. 'If you don't tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly when the Lord gives us the land.'\n\nShe let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was part of the city wall. They told her, 'Tie this scarlet cord in the window and gather your family inside. Anyone in the house with you will be safe. But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the oath.'\n\n'Agreed,' she said, and she tied the scarlet cord in the window.\n\nThe spies hid in the hills for three days until the pursuers returned, then reported to Joshua. 'The Lord has surely given the whole land into our hands. All the people are melting in fear because of us.'\n\nRahab, a Gentile and a sinner, is later listed in the genealogy of Jesus. Her faith saved her household and inserted her into the lineage of the Messiah.",

'They left already!' she said. 'Quick, chase them!' The soldiers ran off in the wrong direction.\n\nThat night, Rahab climbed up to the roof. She told the spies, 'I know your God is the real God! We've heard how He dried up the Red Sea. Everyone here is scared of you!\n\n'Please promise me something. When you take this city, save me and my family. I helped you—please help us!'\n\nThe spies promised. 'We will keep you safe. Hang this red rope from your window. Keep your family inside your house when we attack. Everyone in your house will be saved.'\n\nRahab's house was part of the city wall. She lowered the spies down with a rope, and they escaped!\n\nRahab hung the red rope in her window and waited. She believed God would keep her safe.\n\nAnd He did! When the city fell, Rahab and her whole family were rescued. Rahab even became part of Jesus' family tree!\n\nRahab wasn't a perfect person. But she believed in God, and that faith changed everything. God welcomes anyone who trusts in Him!"

March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days. Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams' horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets. When you hear them sound a long blast, have the whole army give a loud shout. Then the wall of the city will collapse.'\n\nJoshua gave the orders. For six days, they marched around the city once each day. The armed guard went ahead, the priests blowing trumpets came next, the ark of the Lord followed, and the rear guard came behind. Joshua commanded the people: 'Do not give a war cry, do not raise your voices, do not say a word until the day I tell you to shout.'\n\nCan you imagine what the people of Jericho thought? Warriors marching, trumpets blowing, but no attack—just one silent circuit and then back to camp. Day after day. The tension must have been unbearable.\n\nOn the seventh day, they rose at dawn and marched around the city seven times. The seventh time around, when the priests sounded the trumpet blast, Joshua commanded the people: 'Shout! For the Lord has given you the city!'\n\nThe people shouted, the walls collapsed, and every man charged straight in. They devoted the city to the Lord, destroying everything in it. But Joshua spared Rahab and everyone in her house, because she had hidden the spies.\n\nThe battle was won not by military strategy but by obedient faith in God's word.

'The Lord is with you, mighty warrior.'\n\nGideon replied, 'If the Lord is with us, why has all this happened? Where are all His wonders our fathers told us about? The Lord has abandoned us.'\n\nThe Lord turned to him and said, 'Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand.

My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.'\n\n'I will be with you,' the Lord answered, 'and you will strike down all the Midianites together.'\n\nGideon asked for a sign and prepared an offering. The angel touched it with his staff, fire flared from the rock and consumed the offering, and the angel vanished. Gideon was afraid—he had seen the angel of the Lord face to face! But the Lord said, 'Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.'\n\nThat night, God told Gideon to tear down his father's altar to Baal. Gideon obeyed, but he did it at night because he was afraid. When the townspeople discovered what happened and demanded Gideon's death, his father defended him: 'If Baal is a god, let him fight for himself.'\n\nWhen the Midianites and their allies gathered for battle, the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon. He blew a trumpet, and men rallied to him. But Gideon still struggled with doubt.\n\n'If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised,' he said to God, 'I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and the ground is dry, I will know.'\n\nIn the morning, Gideon squeezed a bowlful of water from the fleece, but the ground was dry.\n\nGideon said, 'Do not be angry with me. Let me make one more request. This time make the fleece dry and the ground covered with dew.'\n\nThat night God did so.

'Let all the others go.'\n\nThree hundred against a vast army that lay in the valley, thick as locusts, with camels too numerous to count. Impossible odds—exactly where God wanted them.\n\nThat night, God told Gideon to go down to the enemy camp.

God has given the Midianites into his hands.'\n\nGideon worshipped God. He returned to the Israelite camp and shouted, 'Get up! The Lord has given the Midianite camp into your hands!' He divided the three hundred men into three companies, giving each man a trumpet and an empty jar with a torch inside.\n\n'Watch me and do as I do,' he said. 'When we reach the edge of the camp, blow your trumpets and shout, \"For the Lord and for Gideon!\"'\n\nAt the beginning of the middle watch, Gideon and his hundred reached the camp.

Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us.'\n\nJoshua marched up from Gilgal with his entire army, including all the best fighting men.

Not one of them will be able to withstand you.'\n\nAfter an all-night march from Gilgal, Joshua took them by surprise.

The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day. There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the Lord listened to a human being. Surely the Lord was fighting for Israel!\n\nThe five kings fled and hid in a cave at Makkedah. When Joshua learned where they were hiding, he ordered large stones rolled against the cave's mouth and guards posted. After the battle, the kings were brought out and executed.

More enemies died from the hailstones than from Israel's swords! But the sun was going down, and Joshua needed more time to finish the battle.\n\nSo Joshua did something amazing.

Eglon got the Ammonites and Amalekites to join him, and they attacked Israel and took possession of the City of Palms. The Israelites were subject to Eglon for eighteen years.\n\nAgain the Israelites cried out to the Lord, and He gave them a deliverer—Ehud son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. The Israelites sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Ehud had made a double-edged sword about a cubit long, which he strapped to his right thigh under his clothing.\n\nEhud presented the tribute to Eglon, who was a very fat man. After sending away those who had carried the tribute, Ehud turned back at the stone images near Gilgal and said, 'Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you.' The king said, 'Quiet!' and all his attendants left him.\n\nEhud then approached him while he was sitting alone in the upper room of his palace. 'I have a message from God for you,' Ehud said. As the king rose from his seat, Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh and plunged it into the king's belly. Even the handle sank in after the blade, and his bowels discharged. Ehud did not pull the sword out, and the fat closed in over it.\n\nThen Ehud went out onto the porch, shutting the doors of the upper room behind him and locking them. After he had gone, the servants came and found the doors of the upper room locked. They said, 'He must be relieving himself in the inner room of the palace.' They waited to the point of embarrassment, but when he did not open the doors, they took a key and opened them. There they saw their lord fallen to the floor, dead.\n\nWhile they waited, Ehud got away. He blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down with him from the hills. 'Follow me,' he ordered, 'for the Lord has given Moab, your enemy, into your hands.' They took possession of the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab and did not allow anyone to cross.

Ehud was chosen to bring a gift (called tribute) to King Eglon.\n\nBut Ehud had a secret plan. He made a short, sharp sword and hid it on his right leg under his clothes. Why the right leg? Because everyone else wore swords on their left side! The guards would never think to check there. Being left-handed meant Ehud could reach it easily.\n\nEhud brought the gift to King Eglon. Then he sent his helpers away and came back alone. 'Your Majesty,' Ehud said, 'I have a secret message for you!' The king got excited and sent all his servants out of the room.\n\n'I have a message from God for you,' Ehud said. The king stood up eagerly. Quick as lightning, Ehud reached with his left hand, grabbed his hidden sword, and struck the wicked king!\n\nEhud locked the doors behind him and walked out calmly. The king's servants waited and waited outside. 'He must be busy in there,' they said, too embarrassed to check. Finally they got a key and opened the doors—but it was too late. Ehud was long gone!\n\nEhud blew a trumpet and called the Israelites together. 'Follow me! God has given us victory!' That day, Israel defeated their enemies completely.

      "narrative": "Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior, but he was the son of a prostitute. His half-brothers drove him away, saying, 'You are not going to get any inheritance in our family, because you are the son of another woman.' So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob, where a gang of scoundrels gathered around him.\n\nWhen the Ammonites made war on Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah back. 'Come, be our commander, so we can fight the Ammonites.' Jephthah said, 'Didn't you hate me and drive me from my father's house? Why come to me now when you're in trouble?' The elders promised he would be their head if he fought for them, and Jephthah went with them.\n\nJephthah first tried diplomacy, sending messengers to the king of the Ammonites. When that failed, the Spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah. He advanced against the Ammonites, and then he made a vow to the Lord: 'If you give the Ammonites into my hands, whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph will be the Lord's, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering.'\n\nJephthah crossed over to fight the Ammonites, and the Lord gave them into his hands. He devastated twenty towns. Thus Israel subdued the Ammonites.\n\nWhen Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, who should come out to meet him but his daughter, dancing to the sound of timbrels! She was his only child. Except for her, he had neither son nor daughter.\n\nWhen he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried, 'Oh no, my daughter! You have brought me down and I am devastated. I have made a vow to the Lord that I cannot break.'\n\n'My father,' she replied, 'you have given your word to the Lord. Do to me just as you promised, now that the Lord has avenged you of your enemies.' But she asked for two months to roam the hills and weep with her friends, because she would never marry.\n\nAfter two months, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. She died a virgin. From this came the Israelite tradition that four days each year the young women of Israel would go out to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah.\n\nJephthah judged Israel six years. His story serves as a sobering warning about making rash vows and the weight our words carry before God.",

      "kids_description": "Jephthah was a brave warrior who made a promise to God without thinking carefully. When he won the battle, he learned a hard lesson about how important our words are.",
      "kids_narrative": "Jephthah had a very hard life. His brothers were mean to him and sent him away from home. He had to live far away with a group of rough men.\n\nBut when the Ammonites attacked Israel, the leaders came to find Jephthah. 'Please help us! You're a mighty warrior. Lead us in battle!' Jephthah agreed to help, and God's Spirit came upon him to give him strength.\n\nBefore the battle, Jephthah made a promise to God. But it was a very, very foolish promise. He said, 'If You help me win, whatever comes out of my house first when I get home will belong to You.' He didn't think carefully about what he was saying.\n\nGod gave Jephthah a great victory! He defeated the Ammonites and saved Israel. Then he went home, happy and proud.\n\nBut as he got close to his house, he heard music. Dancing out the door came... his only daughter! She was so excited to see her daddy come home as a hero!\n\nJephthah's heart broke. He tore his clothes and cried, 'Oh no! My daughter! I made a promise to God, and I can't take it back!'\n\nHis brave daughter said, 'Father, if you made a promise to God, you must keep it. God helped you win.' She only asked for two months to say goodbye to her friends.\n\nThis is one of the saddest stories in the Bible. Jephthah kept his terrible promise, and his daughter died. He made a vow without thinking, and it cost him everything he loved.\n\nThis story teaches us something very important: Be very careful what you promise! Think before you speak. Words are powerful, especially promises made to God. It's better to not make a promise at all than to make a foolish one. Always think carefully before you say something you can't take back."

      "narrative": "In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife Naomi and two sons, went to live in the country of Moab.\n\nThe man's name was Elimelech. His sons married Moabite women—one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After about ten years, Elimelech and both sons died, leaving Naomi alone with her two daughters-in-law.\n\nWhen Naomi heard that the Lord had provided food for His people in Judah, she prepared to return home. As she started on the road back, she urged her daughters-in-law, 'Go back, each of you, to your mother's home. May the Lord show you kindness, as you have shown kindness to your dead husbands and to me.'\n\nShe kissed them goodbye, and they wept aloud. 'We will go back with you to your people,' they said.\n\nBut Naomi insisted. 'Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons who could become your husbands? I am too old to have another husband. Even if I had one tonight and bore sons, would you wait until they grew up?'\n\nShe continued, 'No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the Lord's hand has turned against me!'\n\nAt this they wept aloud again. Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her.\n\n'Look,' Naomi said, 'your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.'\n\nBut Ruth replied, 'Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me.'\n\nWhen Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.\n\nSo the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. The whole town was stirred because of them. 'Can this be Naomi?' the women exclaimed.\n\n'Don't call me Naomi,' she told them. 'Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter. I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty.'\n\nSo Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law. They arrived in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.",

      "kids_narrative": "Naomi was so sad. First her husband died. Then her two sons died. She was left all alone in a foreign country with only her two daughters-in-law, Ruth and Orpah.\n\nNaomi decided to go back to her home in Israel. 'You girls should go back to your families,' she told them. 'Find new husbands. I have nothing to give you.'\n\nOrpah cried and hugged Naomi goodbye. Then she left.\n\nBut Ruth wouldn't let go. She held onto Naomi tight.\n\n'Go on!' Naomi said. 'Your sister-in-law is leaving. Go with her!'\n\nRuth said the most beautiful words: 'Don't make me leave you! Where you go, I will go. Where you stay, I will stay. Your people will be my people. Your God will be my God. Where you die, I will die too. Only death will separate us!'\n\nNaomi saw that Ruth really meant it. She stopped trying to send her away.\n\nSo the two women walked all the way to Bethlehem. When they arrived, everyone in town was excited. 'Is that Naomi?'\n\nNaomi was still sad. 'Don't call me Naomi anymore,' she said. 'Call me Mara, which means bitter. I left this place full and happy. I'm coming back empty and sad.'\n\nBut Naomi wasn't really empty. She had Ruth! Ruth had chosen to follow Naomi's God and be part of Naomi's family.\n\nRuth was loyal and loving. She didn't know what would happen, but she trusted God. And God had wonderful plans for Ruth—plans that would bless the whole world!"

      "narrative": "Ruth and Naomi had arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest, but they had nothing. Ruth said to Naomi, 'Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor.'\n\nAs it turned out, she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz, a relative from Elimelech's clan. Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and noticed Ruth. 'Who does that young woman belong to?' he asked his foreman.\n\n'She is the Moabite who came back with Naomi,' the foreman replied. 'She asked to glean behind the harvesters, and she has worked steadily from morning till now.'\n\nBoaz said to Ruth, 'Stay here with my women workers. Watch the field where the men are harvesting and follow along. I have told the men not to touch you. When you are thirsty, drink from the water jars.'\n\nRuth bowed down and asked, 'Why have I found such favor in your eyes? I am only a foreigner.'\n\nBoaz replied, 'I've been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law—how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know. May the Lord repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.'\n\nBoaz told his men to let her gather even among the standing sheaves and to deliberately leave stalks for her. That evening, Ruth went home with an ephah of barley—about thirty pounds!\n\nNaomi was amazed. 'Where did you glean today? Blessed be the man who took notice of you!'\n\n'The man's name is Boaz,' Ruth said.\n\nNaomi's face lit up. 'The Lord bless him! That man is our close relative—one of our kinsman-redeemers!'\n\nIn Israel, a kinsman-redeemer was a relative who could buy back family land and marry a widow to continue the family line. Naomi saw God's hand at work.\n\nThe harvest season passed. Naomi instructed Ruth to go to Boaz on the threshing floor and present herself to him as one seeking redemption. Ruth obeyed. Boaz was deeply moved. 'This kindness is greater than that which you showed earlier,' he said. 'You have not run after the younger men. I will do everything you ask.'\n\nThere was one problem—a closer relative existed. But when that man declined to redeem Ruth, Boaz stepped forward. In front of the town elders, he declared, 'I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelech. I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite as my wife.'\n\nSo Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. The Lord enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son. The women said to Naomi, 'Praise be to the Lord, who has not left you without a redeemer! Your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth.'\n\nThey named the baby Obed. He became the father of Jesse, who became the father of David—the future king. Ruth, the Moabite outsider, was now part of the lineage of the Messiah.",

      "kids_narrative": "Ruth and Naomi were very poor. They needed food!\n\nIn those days, poor people could follow behind farm workers and pick up any grain that was dropped. Ruth said, 'Let me go find food for us.'\n\nShe ended up in a field that belonged to a man named Boaz. She didn't know it, but Boaz was related to Naomi's family!\n\nBoaz came to check on his workers. He noticed Ruth working hard. 'Who is that woman?' he asked.\n\n'She's the one who came from Moab with Naomi,' a worker said. 'She's been working since morning without stopping!'\n\nBoaz went to Ruth. 'Stay in my fields,' he said kindly. 'Don't go anywhere else. Stay close to my workers. I've told the men not to bother you. When you're thirsty, drink from our water jars.'\n\nRuth was amazed! 'Why are you being so nice to me? I'm just a foreigner!'\n\n'I've heard about your love for Naomi,' Boaz said. 'You left your homeland to take care of her and follow her God. May God bless you!'\n\nBoaz also told his workers to leave EXTRA grain for Ruth on purpose!\n\nThat night, Ruth came home with SO much food. Naomi was shocked! When Ruth told her about Boaz, Naomi got excited. 'He's our relative! God is taking care of us!'\n\nAs time went on, Boaz and Ruth got married! They had a baby boy named Obed.\n\nHere's the amazing part: Obed grew up and had a son named Jesse. Jesse had a son named David—the famous king! And many years later, Jesus was born into this same family!\n\nRuth was a foreigner who lost everything. But because she trusted God and stayed loyal to Naomi, she became part of the most important family in history!"
