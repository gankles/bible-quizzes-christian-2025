They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.\n\nNow there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard their own language being spoken. Amazed, they asked, 'Aren't all these who are speaking Galileans? How is it that each of us hears them in our native language?'\n\nSome, however, made fun of them and said, 'They have had too much wine.'\n\nThen Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: 'Fellow Jews, these people are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning! No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: \"In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people.\"'\n\nPeter proclaimed Jesus—His miracles, His death on the cross, His resurrection. 'God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it.'\n\nWhen the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said, 'Brothers, what shall we do?'\n\nPeter replied, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.'\n\nThose who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.",

Suddenly they could speak in languages they had never learned!\n\nJerusalem was crowded with visitors from many countries. They heard the noise and came running.

Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter.'\n\nAbout noon the following day, Peter went up on the roof to pray. He became hungry and fell into a trance.

He found a large gathering of people. He said to them, 'You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile.

The Grecian Jews murmured against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration of food and care.\n\nThe twelve apostles gathered the multitude and said, 'It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.' They instructed the congregation to look among themselves for seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom they might appoint over this business.\n\nThe saying pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, along with Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas. The seven were set before the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands upon them.\n\nThe result was immediate and powerful—the word of God increased, the number of disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly, and even a great company of the priests became obedient to the faith.",

The church was helping widows by giving them food every day. But some of the widows weren't getting their fair share.\n\nThe twelve apostles called everyone together for a meeting. They said, 'We have an important job that God gave us: to pray and to teach people about Jesus. If we spend all our time handing out food, we won't have time to do what God called us to do. So here's what we should do: You choose seven good men who are honest, wise, and full of God's Holy Spirit. We'll put them in charge of making sure the food gets shared fairly.'\n\nEveryone thought this was a great idea! They chose seven men who loved God and whom everyone trusted. Their names were Stephen, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas.\n\nThe apostles put their hands on each man's head and prayed for them. This was a special ceremony that showed everyone that these men were now official helpers in the church.\n\nSomething amazing happened! Because the apostles could now spend more time praying and teaching about Jesus, God's word spread even faster. More and more people kept becoming believers—even many of the Jewish priests started believing in Jesus! The church learned that when everyone uses their gifts to help, the whole church grows stronger."

Neither was there any among them that lacked, for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices and laid them down at the apostles' feet.\n\nAmong these generous believers, one man stood out. Joses, a Levite from Cyprus, was surnamed by the apostles 'Barnabas,' which means 'the son of consolation' or 'son of encouragement.' His new name revealed his character—this was a man who built others up.\n\nBarnabas, having land, sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.

He did great wonders and miracles among the people, speaking with wisdom and the Spirit that none could resist. His boldness stirred up opposition from certain synagogues, who suborned men to bring false accusations against him, claiming he spoke blasphemous words against Moses and against God.\n\nBrought before the council, Stephen's face shone like the face of an angel as he stood accused. When asked if these things were true, he delivered a masterful speech recounting the entire history of Israel, from Abraham through Moses, Solomon's temple, and the prophets. He demonstrated deep knowledge of Scripture and God's dealings with His people throughout the ages.\n\nStephen's speech built to a devastating climax as he turned the tables on his accusers: 'Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.' He accused them of betraying and murdering the Just One, Jesus Christ, just as their fathers had persecuted the prophets. His words cut them to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth in fury.\n\nBut Stephen, full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God. He declared this vision aloud, which drove his accusers into a rage. They cried out with a loud voice, stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord. They cast him out of the city and stoned him, with the witnesses laying down their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul.\n\nAs the stones rained down upon him, Stephen called upon God, saying, 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.' Then he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice, 'Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.'

They told lies about him and brought him before the important leaders. When Stephen stood in front of them, his face glowed like an angel! He wasn't scared at all because God was with him. The leaders asked him, 'Are these bad things they say about you true?'\n\nStephen gave them a long answer, telling them the whole story of God's people from the beginning. He talked about Abraham, Joseph, Moses, and all the prophets. Then he told them something they didn't want to hear: 'You're acting just like your ancestors who hurt God's prophets. And now you've hurt Jesus, God's Son!' This made the leaders very, very angry.\n\nWhile they yelled at him, something amazing happened! Stephen looked up to heaven and saw God's glory. He saw Jesus standing at God's right hand! 'Look!' he said. 'I can see heaven and Jesus!' But the angry people didn't want to hear this. They covered their ears, shouted loudly, and dragged Stephen outside the city.\n\nThe people threw stones at Stephen, but he did something incredible. Just like Jesus did on the cross, Stephen prayed for the people hurting him! He said, 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit' and 'Lord, don't hold this sin against them.' Then he went to be with Jesus in heaven. Stephen was the first person to die for believing in Jesus, and he showed everyone how to be brave and loving, even when things are scary.

Many sold their lands and houses, bringing the money to the apostles' feet for distribution to those in need. Into this atmosphere of radical generosity came Ananias and his wife Sapphira, who sold a possession of their own.\n\nBut Ananias, with his wife's full knowledge and consent, kept back part of the price for themselves while bringing the remainder to the apostles, presenting it as if it were the full amount. This was not merely a private financial decision but a deliberate deception before God and the church. They wanted the recognition that came with generous giving without the actual sacrifice.\n\nWhen Ananias laid the money at Peter's feet, the apostle, filled with discernment from the Holy Spirit, confronted him directly: 'Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?' Peter made clear that the sin was not in keeping some money, which was their right, but in lying about it. 'Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power?' Peter asked. 'Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.'\n\nUpon hearing these words, Ananias fell down immediately and gave up the ghost. Great fear came upon all who heard these things. Young men arose, wrapped his body, carried him out, and buried him. About three hours later, Sapphira entered, not knowing what had happened to her husband. Peter gave her an opportunity to tell the truth: 'Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much?' pointing to the amount Ananias had brought. Sapphira confirmed the lie: 'Yea, for so much.'\n\nPeter pronounced judgment: 'How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.' Immediately she fell down at his feet and yielded up the ghost. The young men came in, found her dead, and carried her out to bury her beside her husband. Great fear came upon all the church and upon all who heard these things. This sobering event demonstrated God's holiness and the seriousness of hypocrisy in the community of believers.",

When someone needed help, others would sell their things and give the money to the apostles to share with everyone. It was beautiful to see people being so generous and kind! Everyone was helping each other like one big, happy family.\n\nA man named Ananias and his wife Sapphira decided to sell some land they owned. That was a nice thing to do! But then they came up with a sneaky plan. They would keep some of the money for themselves, but tell everyone they were giving it all. They wanted people to think they were super generous, even though they really weren't. They both agreed to lie together.\n\nWhen Ananias brought the money to Peter, he pretended it was all the money from the sale. But Peter knew the truth because the Holy Spirit told him! Peter asked Ananias, 'Why did you let Satan fill your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit? The land was yours. The money was yours. You didn't have to give it all. But why did you lie about it? You didn't just lie to people; you lied to God!' When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died right there. Everyone was shocked and scared!\n\nThree hours later, Sapphira came in. She didn't know what had happened to her husband. Peter gave her a chance to tell the truth. He asked, 'Did you sell the land for this amount?' pointing to the money Ananias had brought. Sapphira could have been honest, but she chose to keep lying. 'Yes,' she said, 'that's how much we sold it for.' Peter said, 'How could you and your husband agree to test God's Spirit? The men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out too.' Immediately, Sapphira fell down and died, just like her husband.\n\nThis was a very serious and sad story. God showed everyone in the church that lying is very, very serious, especially lying to Him. God sees everything, even our secret plans and our hearts. The whole church became afraid and learned an important lesson: always tell the truth and be honest, especially with God. God doesn't need our lies or our fake goodness. He wants our honest hearts, even if we're not perfect. It's always better to be truthful than to pretend to be something we're not."

Herod delivered Peter to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him, sixteen men in total taking turns, understanding the supernatural nature of the prisoner he held.\n\nWhile Peter was kept in prison between two soldiers, bound with two chains, with keepers before the door, the church made prayer without ceasing unto God for him. The night before Herod would bring him forth, Peter slept between two soldiers, bound with two chains. Suddenly the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison. The angel smote Peter on the side and raised him up, saying, 'Arise up quickly.' His chains fell off from his hands.\n\nThe angel instructed Peter: 'Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals.' Peter did so. Then the angel said, 'Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.' Peter went out following the angel, thinking he was seeing a vision, not understanding that it was real. They passed the first and second ward, then came to the iron gate leading to the city, which opened to them of its own accord. They went out and passed through one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.\n\nWhen Peter came to himself, he declared, 'Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.' He came to the house of Mary the mother of John Mark, where many were gathered together praying. When he knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel named Rhoda came to hearken. Recognizing Peter's voice, she was so glad that she ran in without opening the gate, telling them Peter stood before the gate.\n\nThey said unto her, 'Thou art mad.' But she constantly affirmed it was so. Then they said, 'It is his angel.' But Peter continued knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished. He beckoned unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared how the Lord had brought him out of the prison, and told them to show these things unto James and the brethren. Then he departed and went to another place. When day came, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter.

It looked like there was no way Peter could escape!\n\nBut Peter's friends in the church didn't give up. They gathered together at a house and prayed and prayed for Peter. They prayed all the time, day and night! They believed God could help Peter, even though the situation looked impossible. Meanwhile, Peter was sleeping in his chains the night before Herod planned to bring him out. Can you imagine sleeping when you're in such danger? Peter must have had great peace from God!\n\nSuddenly, the whole prison cell lit up with a bright light! An angel appeared and tapped Peter on the side. 'Quick, get up!' the angel said. The chains fell right off Peter's hands! Peter thought he was dreaming. The angel told him, 'Put on your sandals and your coat, and follow me.' Peter obeyed, following the angel past the first guard, past the second guard, and then to the big iron gate that led to the city. The gate opened all by itself!

      "characters": ["Paul", "Athenian Philosophers", "Dionysius", "Damaris"],
      "narrative": "While Paul waited at Athens for Silas and Timothy, his spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. Athens, the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient world, was filled with temples, shrines, and statues to countless gods. Paul disputed in the synagogue with the Jews and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him, engaging whoever would listen in discussion about Jesus and the resurrection.\n\nCertain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoicks encountered him. The Epicureans sought pleasure and tranquility, denying divine intervention in human affairs. The Stoics believed in fate and living according to reason and nature. Some said, 'What will this babbler say?' dismissing him as a collector of scraps of knowledge. Others said, 'He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods,' because he preached unto them Jesus and the resurrection. They took him and brought him unto Areopagus, or Mars Hill, the council that dealt with religious and philosophical matters in Athens.\n\nThey asked, 'May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is? For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.' Luke notes that all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing. Their intellectual curiosity provided Paul with an opportunity to present the gospel in terms they could engage with.\n\nPaul stood in the midst of Mars Hill and began his address: 'Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.' He had observed an altar with the inscription, 'TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.' He declared, 'Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.' Paul then proclaimed the one true God: 'God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things.' He dismantled their idolatrous conceptions, showing that the Creator needs nothing from His creatures.\n\nPaul continued, explaining that God made all nations from one blood and determined their times and boundaries, 'That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: For in him we live, and move, and have our being.' He even quoted their own poets: 'For we are also his offspring.' Then Paul applied this truth: 'Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.' Their idols were inadequate representations of the divine.\n\nPaul reached his climax: 'The times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.' When they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, but others said, 'We will hear thee again of this matter.' Some men joined him and believed, including Dionysius the Areopagite, a member of the council, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them. Paul's Mars Hill sermon demonstrated how to engage thoughtfully with philosophical minds while faithfully proclaiming Christ crucified and risen.",

It was famous for its philosophers - very smart people who spent all their time thinking and talking about big ideas. But when Paul looked around the city, he became very sad. Everywhere he looked, he saw statues and temples to fake gods! The people worshiped hundreds of different idols. Paul knew there was only one true God, and these people didn't know Him.\n\nPaul started talking to people in the marketplace every day about Jesus. Some smart philosophers called Epicureans and Stoics heard him and were curious. 'What is this babbler talking about?' some said. 'He seems to be telling us about strange new gods!' They brought Paul to a special place called the Areopagus, also known as Mars Hill, where important people met to discuss new ideas. 'Tell us about this new teaching,' they said. 'We want to know what you're talking about!'\n\nPaul stood up in front of all these very smart people and began to speak. 'Men of Athens,' he said, 'I can see that you are very religious. As I walked around your city, I saw many objects you worship, and I even found an altar with these words: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Well, I'm here to tell you about this God you don't know!' Paul was using something they already had to teach them the truth. How clever!\n\nPaul told them, 'The God who made the whole world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth. He doesn't live in temples made by human hands, and He doesn't need anything from us. Instead, He gives everyone life and breath and everything else! He made all people from one man, and He wants people to seek Him and find Him. In fact, He's not far from any of us! As your own poets have said, \"We are His offspring.\"' Paul was showing them that the real God is nothing like their statues made of gold, silver, or stone.\n\nThen Paul said something very important: 'God overlooked people's ignorance in the past, but now He commands everyone everywhere to repent and turn from their sins. He has set a day when He will judge the world through a man He has chosen - Jesus. And God proved this by raising Jesus from the dead!' When the people heard about someone rising from the dead, some laughed and made fun of Paul. But others said, 'We want to hear more about this!' And some people believed! A man named Dionysius, who was an important council member, and a woman named Damaris, and others became followers of Jesus that day. Paul showed us that we can be wise and smart while still sharing the truth about Jesus with everyone!"
