      "narrative": "A new king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph. Alarmed by the Israelites' growing numbers, he enslaved them and ordered that every Hebrew baby boy be thrown into the Nile.\n\nA Levite woman named Jochebed gave birth to a son and saw he was a fine child. She hid him for three months, but when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket, coated it with tar and pitch, placed the child in it, and set it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile. His sister Miriam stood at a distance to see what would happen.\n\nPharaoh's daughter came down to the Nile to bathe. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it. When she opened it, she saw the baby, crying. Her heart was moved with compassion. 'This is one of the Hebrew babies,' she said.\n\nThen Miriam appeared. 'Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?' she asked.\n\n'Yes, go,' the princess answered. The girl went and got the baby's own mother.\n\nPharaoh's daughter said to her, 'Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.' So Jochebed took her own son and nursed him. When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son.\n\nShe named him Moses, saying, 'I drew him out of the water.' The name sounded like both the Hebrew word for 'draw out' and an Egyptian word for 'son.'\n\nGod had preserved the deliverer in the very household of the one who sought to destroy him. Moses would be raised with the education and skills of Egyptian royalty—training that would one day serve God's purposes.",

She HAD to keep him safe!\n\nFor three months, she hid her baby. But babies get bigger and louder. She couldn't hide him forever.\n\nSo she made a little basket boat! She made it waterproof and put her baby inside. She placed the basket in the tall grass by the river. The baby's big sister Miriam hid nearby to watch.\n\nGuess who came to the river? The princess—the king's own daughter! She saw the basket and looked inside.\n\nWAH! WAH! The baby was crying!\n\nThe princess felt sorry for him. 'This must be a Hebrew baby,' she said. Her heart was full of love for him.\n\nMiriam was brave. She ran up to the princess. 'Do you need someone to take care of the baby? I know someone!'\n\n'Yes!' said the princess.\n\nGuess who came to help? The baby's own mommy! The princess said, 'Take care of this baby for me. I'll even pay you!'\n\nSo Moses got to stay with his real mommy until he was older. Then he went to live in the palace as the princess's son. She named him Moses, which means 'pulled from the water.'\n\nGod had a BIG plan for Moses. And God kept him safe so that plan could happen!"

There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush.

Moses!'\n\n'Here I am,' Moses replied.\n\n'Do not come any closer,' God said. 'Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground. I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' Moses hid his face, afraid to look at God.\n\n'I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt,' the Lord continued. 'I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers. So I have come down to rescue them and bring them into a good and spacious land, flowing with milk and honey. So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people out of Egypt.'\n\nMoses began making excuses. 'Who am I to go to Pharaoh?' God answered, 'I will be with you.'\n\n'What if they ask Your name?' God replied, 'I AM WHO I AM. Tell them I AM has sent you.'\n\n'What if they don't believe me?' God gave Moses signs—his staff became a snake, his hand became leprous and was healed.\n\n'I am slow of speech!' Moses protested. God's anger burned. 'Your brother Aaron can speak for you.

Each plague struck at a specific Egyptian deity, proving the Lord's supremacy.\n\nThe first plague turned the Nile to blood—an attack on Hapi, the god of the Nile. Fish died, the river stank, and Egyptians could not drink. Pharaoh's magicians copied the sign, and Pharaoh hardened his heart.\n\nFrogs covered the land—a mockery of Heqet, the frog goddess of fertility. They were in beds, ovens, everywhere. Pharaoh begged Moses to pray, promising to let Israel go. But when the frogs died, he hardened his heart again.\n\nGnats came without warning—something the magicians could not replicate. 'This is the finger of God,' they said. But Pharaoh's heart remained hard.\n\nSwarms of flies filled Egypt, but not Goshen where Israel lived. God was making a distinction between His people and Egypt.\n\nThe livestock died—a blow to Apis, the bull god, and Hathor, the cow goddess. Yet Pharaoh would not relent.\n\nBoils broke out on man and beast. The magicians could not even stand before Moses.\n\nHail destroyed crops and killed anyone caught outside. Some Egyptians heeded Moses' warning; others did not.\n\nLocusts devoured everything the hail had left. 'I have sinned!' Pharaoh cried, but his repentance was false.\n\nDarkness covered Egypt for three days—so thick it could be felt. Ra, the sun god, was powerless.

But the Hebrew animals were fine. Pharaoh said NO.\n\nPLAGUE 6: Painful SORES broke out on everyone in Egypt. So itchy and ouchy! Pharaoh said NO.\n\nPLAGUE 7: HAIL crashed down from the sky! Thunder boomed! Some people listened to Moses' warning and stayed inside. Others didn't. Pharaoh said NO.\n\nPLAGUE 8: LOCUSTS ate every plant left after the hail. Everything green was gone! Pharaoh said NO.\n\nPLAGUE 9: DARKNESS covered Egypt for three days. It was so dark nobody could see anything! But the Hebrews had light. Pharaoh STILL said NO.\n\nNine times God showed His power. Nine times Pharaoh's heart stayed hard. One more plague would come—the worst one yet."

Take care of it until the fourteenth day, then slaughter it at twilight.\n\n'Take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of your houses. Roast the lamb over fire and eat it with bitter herbs and bread made without yeast. Eat with your cloak tucked into your belt, sandals on your feet, staff in your hand. Eat in haste—it is the Lord's Passover.\n\n'On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn, both people and animals. I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the Lord. The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you.'\n\nThe Israelites did exactly as God commanded. At midnight, the Lord struck down all the firstborn in Egypt—from Pharaoh's son who sat on the throne to the firstborn of the prisoner in the dungeon. Pharaoh arose in the night, and there was loud wailing throughout Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead.\n\n'Up! Leave my people!' Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. 'Go worship the Lord as you have requested. Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me.'\n\nThe Egyptians urged the people to hurry, giving them silver, gold, and clothing. After 430 years, the Israelites left Egypt—about 600,000 men on foot, besides women and children.\n\n'This is a day you are to commemorate,' God said.

Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again. The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still.'\n\nThen the Lord said to Moses, 'Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on.

In the morning watch, the Lord looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud and threw the Egyptian army into confusion. He jammed their chariot wheels.\n\n'Let's get away from the Israelites!' the Egyptians cried. 'The Lord is fighting for them!'\n\nThen God told Moses to stretch out his hand over the sea.

God has come to test you, so that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from sinning.'\n\nMoses approached the thick darkness where God was, and God gave him laws for Israel—not just the Ten Commandments, but detailed instructions for justice, worship, and daily life.

Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation.'\n\nBut Moses sought the favor of the Lord. 'Why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt? Why should the Egyptians say you brought them out to kill them? Turn from your fierce anger. Remember your promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.'\n\nThe Lord relented.\n\nMoses went down the mountain with the two tablets. When he approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned. He threw the tablets down, breaking them at the foot of the mountain.

      "narrative": "As Israel camped on the plains of Moab, King Balak was terrified. He had seen what Israel did to the Amorites and knew he could not defeat them in battle. So he sent messengers to Balaam, a prophet known for his powerful curses, offering rich rewards if he would come and curse Israel.\n\nGod came to Balaam in the night and said, 'You must not go with them. You must not put a curse on those people, because they are blessed.' Balaam refused to go. But when Balak sent more distinguished princes with promises of great honor, Balaam asked God again. God permitted him to go, but only to speak what God would tell him.\n\nBalaam set out on his donkey. But the angel of the Lord stood in the road to oppose him, sword drawn and ready. The donkey saw the angel and turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat her to get her back on the road. The angel stood again in a narrow path between vineyard walls. The donkey pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam's foot. He beat her again. Finally, the angel stood where there was no room to turn. The donkey lay down under Balaam, and he beat her with his staff.\n\nThen the Lord opened the donkey's mouth. 'What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?' she asked. Balaam answered angrily, 'You have made a fool of me! If I had a sword, I would kill you!'\n\nThe donkey said, 'Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?' 'No,' Balaam admitted.\n\nThen the Lord opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel with drawn sword. He fell facedown. The angel said, 'Why have you beaten your donkey three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is reckless. The donkey saw me and turned away. If she had not, I would certainly have killed you by now.'\n\nBalaam confessed his sin and offered to go back. But the angel said, 'Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you.'\n\nThree times Balak took Balaam to overlook the Israelite camps, hoping for a curse. Three times Balaam opened his mouth and blessed Israel instead. 'How can I curse those whom God has not cursed?' he declared. His final oracle spoke of a star rising from Jacob and a scepter from Israel—a prophecy pointing to the coming Messiah.\n\nBalak was furious, but God had turned the intended curses into blessings, protecting His people through most unexpected means—a speaking donkey and a pagan prophet who could only speak God's words.",

      "kids_description": "A king wanted Balaam to curse Israel, but God sent an angel to stop him. Balaam's donkey could see the angel when Balaam couldn't! Then God made the donkey talk! Instead of cursing Israel, Balaam blessed them.",
      "kids_narrative": "The Israelites were camped near the country of Moab. King Balak was scared of them! 'There are too many Israelites! They'll eat up everything like locusts!' He knew he couldn't beat them in a fight, so he had a sneaky idea. He would hire a man named Balaam to put a curse on Israel.\n\nBalak sent important messengers to Balaam with lots of money. 'Come curse these people for me!' But God told Balaam, 'Don't go. Don't curse Israel. I have blessed them!' So Balaam said no. But Balak sent even MORE important people with promises of great rewards. This time, God let Balaam go, but said, 'Only say what I tell you to say.'\n\nBalaam got on his donkey and started his journey. But God was angry because Balaam's heart wasn't right. God sent an angel to stand in the road with a big sword! The donkey saw the angel and ran off the road into a field. Balaam got mad and hit the donkey.\n\nThey went on. The angel stood in a narrow path between walls. The donkey squeezed against the wall, hurting Balaam's foot. Balaam hit her again!\n\nFinally, the angel blocked the whole path. The donkey just lay down! Balaam was furious and beat her with his stick.\n\nThen something AMAZING happened! God made the donkey TALK! 'What did I do wrong? Why did you hit me three times?' The donkey was actually talking!\n\nBalaam yelled at his donkey, 'You made me look foolish! If I had a sword, I'd kill you!' The donkey answered, 'Haven't I always been a good donkey? Have I ever acted like this before?' Balaam had to admit, 'No.'\n\nThen God opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel with the sword! He fell down on his face. The angel said, 'Your donkey saved your life! She saw me when you didn't. If she hadn't stopped, I would have killed you!'\n\nBalaam was sorry. He went on to meet King Balak, but every time Balak asked him to curse Israel, Balaam blessed them instead! God turned the curses into blessings. No one can curse what God has blessed!"

      "narrative": "Moses was one hundred and twenty years old, and his time had come. He gathered all Israel and said, 'I am no longer able to lead you. The Lord has said to me, \"You shall not cross over this Jordan.\" The Lord your God himself will cross over before you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua also will cross over before you, as the Lord has said.'\n\nMoses called Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, 'Be strong and courageous, for you must go with this people into the land that the Lord swore to give to their fathers, and you shall put them in possession of it. It is the Lord who goes before you. He will be with you; he will not leave you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed.'\n\nAfter Moses died and was buried, the Lord spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses' assistant: 'Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them. Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given to you, just as I promised to Moses. From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your territory.'\n\nThe Lord continued with powerful promises: 'No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you or forsake you. Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their fathers to give them.'\n\nThree times God commanded Joshua to be strong and courageous. The third time, He added the key to success: 'Only be strong and very courageous, being careful to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go. This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.'\n\nJoshua commanded the officers of the people to go through the camp: 'Prepare your provisions, for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan to go in to take possession of the land.' The people answered Joshua, 'All that you have commanded us we will do. Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you. Only may the Lord your God be with you, as he was with Moses!'",

Someone else would do that—a brave man named Joshua.\n\nMoses called Joshua in front of everyone. 'Be strong and courageous!' Moses told him. 'You will lead these people into the land God promised. Don't be afraid! God will go with you. He will never leave you.'\n\nThen Moses died. He was 120 years old! God buried him in a secret place, and the people cried for thirty days.\n\nAfter that, God spoke to Joshua: 'Moses is gone now. It's time for you to lead my people across the Jordan River into the land I'm giving them. Everywhere you walk, I'm giving to you! No one will be able to stop you. Just as I was with Moses, I will be with you. I will NEVER leave you. I will NEVER give up on you.'\n\nGod told Joshua something very important three times: 'Be strong and courageous!' It must have been really important for God to say it three times! But God didn't just say 'be brave.' He told Joshua WHY he could be brave: because God would be with him.\n\nGod also told Joshua to read His Word and think about it day and night. 'If you obey my commands,' God said, 'you will be successful wherever you go.'\n\nJoshua sent word to all the people: 'Get ready! In three days, we're crossing the Jordan River to take the land God has promised us!'\n\nThe people answered Joshua, 'We will obey you just like we obeyed Moses! Be strong and courageous!' They were ready to follow their new leader.\n\nJoshua had big shoes to fill. But God promised to be with him every step of the way. When God is with us, we can be brave too!"

      "characters": ["Moses", "Aaron", "Israelites"],
      "narrative": "Just one month after their miraculous exodus from Egypt, the entire congregation of Israel gathered against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness of Sin. Their complaint was bitter: 'Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full!' Memory proved selective—they romanticized their slavery, forgetting the brutal taskmasters and murdered infants. The LORD heard their murmuring and responded not with judgment but with grace. He promised Moses, 'I will rain bread from heaven for you.' That evening, quail covered the camp, providing meat. The next morning, when the dew lifted, thin flakes like hoarfrost covered the ground. 'What is it?' the people asked—'Manna' in Hebrew. Moses explained God's instructions: gather an omer per person daily, but on the sixth day, gather double, for the seventh is the Sabbath rest. This provision became a test of obedience. Some tried to hoard manna overnight; it bred worms and stank. Some sought it on the Sabbath; they found none. For forty years, until they entered Canaan, this bread from heaven sustained Israel. The manna tasted like wafers made with honey, could be baked or boiled, and ceased only when they ate the fruit of the Promised Land. God commanded Moses to preserve an omer of manna in a golden pot before the Testimony, a memorial for future generations. This daily bread became a profound spiritual lesson: man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. Jesus later identified Himself as the true bread from heaven, the reality of which manna was merely a shadow.",

      "kids_narrative": "The people of Israel were traveling through a big, hot desert. They had no farms, no stores, and their food was running out. Instead of trusting God to help them, they started complaining to Moses. 'We're going to starve out here!' they cried. 'At least in Egypt we had food to eat!' They forgot how mean the Egyptians had been to them. God heard their complaining, but instead of being angry, He decided to do something amazing. He told Moses, 'I'm going to make food rain down from heaven! Every morning there will be special bread on the ground, and every evening I'll send birds for meat.' That evening, just like God said, a huge flock of quail birds flew into the camp. The people caught them and had meat for dinner. The next morning, something very strange appeared on the ground. It looked like little white flakes, kind of like frost. 'What is it?' everyone asked. Moses said, 'This is the bread God has given you to eat!' They called it manna, which means 'What is it?' It tasted sweet, like honey wafers. God gave them some special rules: collect just enough for your family each day. Don't try to save it for tomorrow, or it will go bad and get wormy. But on Friday, collect twice as much, because Saturday is a day of rest. Some people didn't listen and tried to keep manna overnight. In the morning—yuck! It was full of worms and smelled terrible. But the manna collected on Friday stayed fresh for Saturday. Every single morning for forty years, God sent manna. He took care of His people every single day!"

      "narrative": "Following the LORD's command, Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin and camped at Rephidim. There was no water. What should have been an opportunity to witness God's continued faithfulness became instead a moment of crisis and rebellion. The people, their throats parched, 'did chide with Moses'—they quarreled and contended with him violently. Their complaint escalated from request to accusation: 'Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?' They questioned the very exodus itself, suggesting Moses had brought them to the wilderness to die. Their unbelief was so fierce that Moses cried unto the LORD, 'What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.' God's response demonstrated both His patience and His power. He instructed Moses to take the elders of Israel and his rod—the same rod that struck the Nile and brought forth plagues—and go before the people. 'Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it.' The imagery is profound: Moses struck the rock, and living water gushed forth for the people to drink. Moses named the place Massah (testing) and Meribah (strife), memorializing Israel's sin: 'Is the LORD among us, or not?' Despite seeing ten plagues, the parting of the Red Sea, the pillar of fire and cloud, manna from heaven, and quail in abundance, they still doubted God's presence and provision. Paul later identified this Rock as Christ, struck once that streams of living water might flow to a thirsting world. The geological impossibility—water from solid rock in a desert—became a spiritual certainty: our Rock was smitten that we might drink freely of salvation's waters.",

But when they set up camp at a place called Rephidim, there was a big problem—no water anywhere! The people became angry and scared. Instead of asking God nicely for help, they yelled at Moses. 'Why did you bring us out here to die of thirst?' they shouted. 'Our children are thirsty! Our animals are thirsty! We're all going to die!' They were so mad that Moses thought they might throw stones at him! Moses didn't know what to do, so he prayed to God. 'Lord, help me! The people are so angry they might hurt me!' God had a plan. He told Moses, 'Take your walking stick—the same one you used when I did miracles in Egypt. Bring the leaders of the people with you, and I'll meet you at a big rock on the mountain.' Moses obeyed. He walked to the rock with the leaders following behind him. God said, 'Now hit the rock with your stick.' That seemed strange! How could hitting a rock give them water? But Moses trusted God. He lifted his stick and struck the rock hard. Suddenly—whoosh! Water came gushing out of the solid rock! Fresh, clean, cold water poured out like a river. All the people drank. Their children drank. All their animals drank. There was plenty for everyone! God had done the impossible. Moses called that place Massah and Meribah, which mean 'testing' and 'arguing,' to remind the people that they should trust God instead of complaining. God always takes care of His people!"
