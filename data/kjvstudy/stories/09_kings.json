      "narrative": "There was a man named Elkanah who had two wives: Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. Year after year, when the family went up to worship at Shiloh, Peninnah would provoke Hannah and irritate her because of her barrenness. Hannah wept and would not eat.\n\nOne year at Shiloh, Hannah rose after they had eaten and stood before the Lord in bitterness of soul, weeping much. She made a vow: 'Lord Almighty, if you will only look on your servant's misery and remember me, if you will give me a son, I will give him to the Lord for all the days of his life.'\n\nAs she kept praying, her lips moved but no sound came out. Eli the priest, watching from his seat by the doorpost, thought she was drunk. 'How long will you keep getting drunk? Get rid of your wine.'\n\n'Not so, my lord,' Hannah replied. 'I am a woman deeply troubled. I have not been drinking. I was pouring out my soul to the Lord. I have been praying out of my great anguish and grief.'\n\nEli answered, 'Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant what you have asked.'\n\nHannah went her way, ate something, and her face was no longer downcast. She believed.\n\nIn the course of time, Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, 'Because I asked the Lord for him.'\n\nWhen the boy was weaned, Hannah took him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh. 'I prayed for this child,' she told Eli, 'and the Lord has granted what I asked. So now I give him to the Lord. For his whole life he will be given over to the Lord.'\n\nHannah worshipped the Lord there, then went home, leaving her precious son to serve in the temple. Her prayer of dedication became one of the most beautiful songs in Scripture, later echoed by Mary the mother of Jesus.",

Every year when her family went to worship God, she would cry and cry.\n\nOne day, Hannah was so sad she couldn't even eat. She went to God's house and prayed. She prayed SO hard—her lips were moving, but no sound came out. Tears rolled down her cheeks.\n\n'God, please, PLEASE give me a baby boy! If You do, I promise—I'll give him back to You. He'll serve You his whole life!'\n\nThe priest Eli saw her crying and thought something was wrong. Hannah explained, 'I'm not drunk. I'm just SO sad. I'm pouring my heart out to God.'\n\nEli said kindly, 'Go in peace. May God give you what you asked for.'\n\nSomething changed in Hannah's heart. She believed God heard her. She ate dinner and wasn't sad anymore.\n\nAnd guess what? God answered her prayer! Hannah had a baby boy! She named him Samuel, which sounds like the Hebrew words for 'asked of God.'\n\nHannah loved Samuel so much. But she remembered her promise. When Samuel was old enough, she took him to God's house.\n\n'I prayed for this child,' she told Eli. 'God gave him to me. Now I'm giving him back to God.'\n\nHannah left Samuel there to help Eli and serve God. It must have been hard! But Hannah trusted God. She visited Samuel every year and brought him a new coat she made.\n\nGod blessed Hannah with more children. And Samuel grew up to be one of the most important people in the whole Bible!\n\nGod hears our prayers, even when we're crying too hard to speak out loud."

Eli, whose eyes were becoming weak, was lying down in his usual place. The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the house of the Lord, where the ark of God was.\n\nThen the Lord called Samuel. 'Here I am,' Samuel answered, and he ran to Eli. 'Here I am; you called me.'\n\n'I did not call,' Eli said. 'Go back and lie down.'\n\nThe Lord called again, 'Samuel!' And Samuel got up and went to Eli. 'Here I am; you called me.'\n\n'My son,' Eli said, 'I did not call. Go back and lie down.'\n\nNow Samuel did not yet know the Lord; the word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him.\n\nA third time the Lord called, 'Samuel!' And again Samuel went to Eli. 'Here I am; you called me.'\n\nThen Eli realized that the Lord was calling the boy. So Eli told Samuel, 'Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, \"Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.\"'\n\nSamuel went and lay down in his place. The Lord came and stood there, calling as at the other times, 'Samuel! Samuel!'\n\nThen Samuel said, 'Speak, for your servant is listening.'\n\nThe Lord told Samuel difficult news—that He was about to judge Eli's family because of the sins of Eli's sons, which Eli knew about but failed to restrain.\n\nSamuel lay down until morning, then opened the doors of the house of the Lord. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision. But Eli called him. 'What was it he said to you? Do not hide it from me.'\n\nSo Samuel told him everything. Eli said, 'He is the Lord; let him do what is good in his eyes.'\n\nThe Lord was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of Samuel's words fall to the ground. All Israel recognized that Samuel was a prophet of the Lord.",

He was confused. Who was calling?\n\n'Samuel!'\n\nA third time, Samuel ran to Eli. 'Here I am!'\n\nNow Eli understood. It wasn't him calling—it was GOD! Eli told Samuel, 'Go lie down. If you hear the voice again, say: \"Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.\"'\n\nSamuel went back to bed. His heart was probably beating fast!\n\n'Samuel! Samuel!'\n\nThis time Samuel knew what to say. 'Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.'\n\nGod spoke to Samuel that night. He told Samuel important things—hard things about what would happen to Eli's family.\n\nIn the morning, Samuel was scared to tell Eli. But Eli asked, and Samuel told him everything.\n\nFrom that night on, Samuel listened for God's voice. He grew up to be a great prophet. Everyone in Israel knew that God spoke through Samuel.\n\nGod still speaks to us today—through the Bible, through prayer, through people who love Him. The important thing is to listen and say, 'Speak, Lord, I'm listening!'"

The two armies faced each other on opposite hills, with the valley between them.\n\nA champion named Goliath came out from the Philistine camp. He was over nine feet tall. He had a bronze helmet, wore a coat of scale armor weighing 125 pounds, and carried a bronze javelin and an iron-pointed spear whose head alone weighed fifteen pounds. A shield-bearer went ahead of him.\n\nGoliath stood and shouted to the Israelite ranks: 'Why do you come out and line up for battle? Choose a man and have him come down to me. If he kills me, we will become your subjects; but if I kill him, you will become our subjects.' Morning and evening for forty days, Goliath took his stand and issued his challenge. Saul and all the Israelites were terrified.\n\nDavid, the youngest son of Jesse, tended his father's sheep at Bethlehem but went back and forth to the Israelite camp. When Jesse sent David with food for his brothers, David heard Goliath's challenge. He saw the Israelites running away in fear.\n\n'Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?' David asked.\n\nHis brothers were angry at his boldness, but David's words reached Saul, who sent for him. 'Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine,' David told the king. 'Your servant will go and fight him.'\n\n'You are not able,' Saul said. 'You are only a boy, and he has been a fighting man from his youth.'\n\nBut David replied, 'Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear that attacked my father's sheep. This uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. The Lord who delivered me from the lion and the bear will deliver me from this Philistine.'\n\nSaul dressed David in his own armor, but David could not walk in it. 'I cannot go in these,' he said. He took his staff, chose five smooth stones from the stream, and with his sling in hand approached the Philistine.\n\nGoliath looked David over and despised him. 'Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks? Come here, and I'll give your flesh to the birds!'\n\nDavid answered, 'You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. This day the Lord will deliver you into my hands, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves; for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give all of you into our hands.'\n\nAs Goliath moved closer to attack, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him. Reaching into his bag, he took out a stone, slung it, and struck Goliath on the forehead. The stone sank in, and the giant fell facedown on the ground.\n\nDavid ran and stood over him, drew Goliath's own sword, and killed him.

He wore heavy armor and carried a huge spear.\n\nEvery day, Goliath yelled at the Israelites. 'Send someone to fight me! If he wins, we'll be your slaves. If I win, you'll be OUR slaves!'\n\nAll the soldiers were TERRIFIED. Even King Saul was scared. For forty days, nobody was brave enough to fight.\n\nThen along came David. He was just a teenager who took care of sheep. His dad sent him to bring food to his older brothers in the army.\n\nWhen David heard Goliath making fun of God's people, he got angry. 'Who does this guy think he is? He's making fun of the armies of the LIVING GOD!'\n\nDavid told King Saul, 'I'll fight him!'\n\n'You're just a kid!' Saul said.\n\n'I've killed lions and bears that attacked my sheep,' David said. 'God saved me from them. He'll save me from this Philistine too!'\n\nSaul tried to give David armor, but it was too big and heavy. David took it off. Instead, he picked up five smooth stones from a stream and took his sling—the kind shepherds use.\n\nGoliath saw David coming and laughed. 'Am I a dog, that you come at me with a stick? I'll feed you to the birds!'\n\nDavid shouted back, 'You come with a sword and spear. But I come in the name of the LORD! Today everyone will know that God doesn't need swords to save people. The battle belongs to the LORD!'\n\nDavid ran TOWARD the giant. He put a stone in his sling, swung it around, and let it fly.\n\nWHACK! The stone hit Goliath right in the forehead. The giant fell CRASH on his face. Dead!\n\nThe Philistines ran away. Israel won!\n\nDavid wasn't big or strong. But he trusted in a big, strong God. That's what made the difference!"

'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands,' the women sang. Saul was furious. From that time on, Saul kept a jealous eye on David, and twice tried to kill him with a spear.\n\nDavid fled and found Jonathan. 'What have I done? What is my crime? Why is your father trying to kill me?'\n\n'Never!' Jonathan protested. 'My father doesn't do anything without telling me. He wouldn't hide this from me.'\n\n'Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes,' David replied. 'He said to himself, \"Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.\" As surely as the Lord lives, there is only a step between me and death.'\n\nJonathan agreed to find out his father's intentions. They made a plan involving arrows as signals. Jonathan would shoot arrows near where David was hiding; his words to the servant boy retrieving them would tell David whether it was safe or not.\n\nAt the new moon feast, Saul noticed David's absence and grew suspicious. When Jonathan defended David, Saul hurled his spear at his own son. Now Jonathan knew—his father was determined to kill David.\n\nIn the morning, Jonathan went out to the field with a young boy. He shot an arrow beyond the boy and called out, 'Isn't the arrow beyond you? Hurry! Go quickly! Don't stop!' These were the words that meant danger.\n\nAfter the boy left, David came out from hiding. He bowed before Jonathan three times with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together—but David wept the most.\n\nJonathan said to David, 'Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the Lord, saying, \"The Lord is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.\"'\n\nDavid left, and Jonathan went back to town.

Jonathan would go to dinner with his father.

You have continued this great kindness to him and have given him a son to sit on his throne this very day.\n\n'Now, Lord my God, you have made your servant king in place of my father David.

For who is able to govern this great people of yours?'\n\nThe Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this. 'Since you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself, nor for the death of your enemies, but for discernment in administering justice, I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like you, nor will there ever be.\n\n'Moreover, I will give you what you have not asked for—both wealth and honor—so that in your lifetime you will have no equal among kings. And if you walk in obedience to me and keep my decrees and commands as David your father did, I will give you a long life.'\n\nThen Solomon awoke—it had been a dream. He returned to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the Lord's covenant, and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then he gave a feast for all his court.\n\nSolomon's wisdom soon became legendary.

I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too.'\n\nThe Lord said, 'Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord, for the Lord is about to pass by.'\n\nThen a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake came a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper.\n\nWhen Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave.\n\nA voice said to him, 'What are you doing here, Elijah?'\n\nAgain Elijah poured out his complaint. Again he said he was all alone.\n\nBut the Lord had work for him to do—kings to anoint, a successor to appoint. And God corrected Elijah's despair: 'I reserve seven thousand in Israel—all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal.'\n\nElijah was not alone. God came to him not in dramatic displays of power, but in a still, small voice. Sometimes that is exactly what a weary soul needs.",

      "narrative": "Saul had been pursuing David with three thousand chosen men of Israel. When Saul entered a cave to relieve himself, he did not know that David and his men were hiding in the recesses of that very cave.\n\nDavid's men whispered to him, 'This is the day the Lord spoke of when he said, \"I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.\"' David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul's robe.\n\nAfterward, David was conscience-stricken for having done even this. He said to his men, 'The Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the Lord's anointed, or lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the Lord.' With these words David sharply rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul.\n\nWhen Saul left the cave and went on his way, David went out and called after him, 'My lord the king!' When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down prostrate before him.\n\n'Why do you listen when men say, \"David is bent on harming you\"?' David asked. 'This day you have seen with your own eyes how the Lord delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you. I said, \"I will not lift my hand against my master, because he is the Lord's anointed.\" See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life. May the Lord judge between you and me.'\n\nSaul wept aloud. 'You are more righteous than I,' he said. 'You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly. You have just now told me of the good you did to me; the Lord delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me. When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the Lord reward you well for the way you treated me today. I know that you will surely be king.'\n\nDavid refused to take vengeance into his own hands, trusting that God would judge between them.

It was dark in the back of the cave.\n\nDavid's men got excited. They whispered, 'This is it! God gave you this chance! Get him!'\n\nDavid could have killed Saul right there. Nobody would have known. Saul was trying to kill HIM, after all! It would be self-defense!\n\nBut David didn't attack. Instead, he quietly crept up and cut off just a little piece of Saul's robe. Then he snuck back into the shadows.\n\nEven after that, David felt bad! 'I shouldn't have done even that,' he told his men. 'Saul is still the king God chose. I won't hurt God's anointed king, no matter what he's done to me.'\n\nWhen Saul walked out of the cave, David followed him. 'My lord the king!' he called out.\n\nSaul turned around, shocked!\n\nDavid bowed down and held up the piece of robe. 'Look! I could have killed you in that cave. People told me to do it. But I didn't! I cut your robe to prove I was close enough. I don't want to hurt you. Why are you hunting me?'\n\nSaul started to cry. 'You're a better man than me, David! I've been terrible to you, and you showed me kindness. I know you'll be king someday. May God bless you.'\n\nDavid could have gotten revenge. But he trusted God to handle things. Revenge belongs to God, not to us. It's better to show mercy and let God make things right."

There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah.\n\nIn the fourteenth year of Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. The Assyrian empire was the most powerful military force in the world. They had already conquered the northern kingdom of Israel and carried its people into exile. Now they surrounded Jerusalem.\n\nSennacherib sent his field commander with a large army to Jerusalem. Standing outside the walls, the commander shouted in Hebrew so all could hear: 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you! Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the Lord. Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the king of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Did they rescue Samaria?'\n\nWhen King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the Lord. He sent word to the prophet Isaiah, who replied, 'Do not be afraid of what you have heard. I am going to put a spirit in the king of Assyria so that he will return to his own country.'\n\nBut then Sennacherib sent messengers with a letter to Hezekiah: 'Do not let the god you depend on deceive you. Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered?'\n\nHezekiah received the letter, read it, and went up to the temple of the Lord. He spread the letter out before the Lord and prayed: 'Lord, the God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. Give ear, Lord, and hear. It is true, Lord, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste these nations. Now, Lord our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone, Lord, are God.'\n\nIsaiah sent word to Hezekiah: 'This is what the Lord says concerning the king of Assyria: He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. By the way he came he will return. I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant.'\n\nThat night the angel of the Lord went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning—there were all the dead bodies! So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh, where his own sons struck him down with the sword.\n\nHezekiah's response to crisis—spreading the problem before the Lord in prayer—demonstrated that true security comes not from military might but from trust in God.",

He also sent a message to the prophet Isaiah.\n\nIsaiah sent back good news: 'Don't be afraid! God will take care of this.'\n\nBut then a letter came from the Assyrian king. It was full of threats and insults about God. 'Your God is no different from all the other gods we've crushed!'\n\nWhat did Hezekiah do? He took that scary letter straight to the temple. He spread it out on the floor in front of God and prayed:\n\n'Lord, You are the ONLY true God! You made everything! Please hear what this king is saying against You. It's true—they HAVE destroyed other nations and their fake gods. But YOU are different! Please save us so everyone will know YOU are the only real God!'\n\nGod answered through Isaiah: 'I have heard your prayer! The Assyrian king won't even shoot ONE arrow at Jerusalem! I will protect this city for my own honor!'\n\nThat very night, something amazing happened. An angel of the Lord went through the Assyrian camp. In the morning, 185,000 enemy soldiers were dead!

He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord and walked in all the ways of his father David, not turning aside to the right or to the left.\n\nIn the eighteenth year of his reign, King Josiah sent his secretary Shaphan to the temple of the Lord. 'Go up to Hilkiah the high priest and have him get ready the money that has been brought into the temple. Have them pay the workers who repair the temple.'\n\nWhile the money was being brought out, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the Lord that had been given through Moses. He gave it to Shaphan the secretary, who brought it to the king and read from it in his presence.\n\nWhen the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his robes. He commanded, 'Go and inquire of the Lord for me and for the people concerning the words of this book that has been found. Great is the Lord's anger that burns against us because our ancestors have not obeyed the words of this book.'\n\nThey went to the prophetess Huldah, who lived in Jerusalem. She said, 'This is what the Lord says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people—all the curses written in the book that was read in the presence of the king. Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods, my anger will be poured out on this place. But as for the king of Judah, tell him this: Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard what I have spoken, and because you tore your robes and wept in my presence, I also have heard you. You will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place.'\n\nThen the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. He went up to the temple with all the people of Judah, from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found. The king stood by the pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the Lord—to follow the Lord and keep his commands with all his heart and soul. And all the people pledged themselves to the covenant.\n\nJosiah then led the most thorough reform in Judah's history. He destroyed the pagan altars, removed the idols, and celebrated Passover as it had not been observed since the days of the judges.

The book told what God expected from His people—but they hadn't been obeying ANY of it!

Despite knowing she was married, David sent for her, lay with her, and she conceived. One sin spiraled into deeper darkness. To cover his adultery, David summoned Uriah from battle, expecting him to go home to his wife. But Uriah's integrity exceeded his king's: 'The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents... shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife?' Even when David made him drunk, Uriah would not compromise his soldier's oath. David's solution was murder by proxy. He sent Uriah back to battle carrying his own death warrant: a letter instructing Joab to place Uriah in the fiercest fighting, then withdraw support. Uriah died. After Bathsheba's mourning, David took her as his wife. 'But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.' God sent Nathan the prophet, who told a parable about a rich man with many flocks who stole a poor man's one beloved lamb to feed his guest. David's righteous anger flared: 'The man that hath done this thing shall surely die!' Nathan's response cut to the heart: 'Thou art the man.' The prophet recounted God's blessings to David, then pronounced judgment: the sword would never depart from his house, evil would rise from his own family, and the child born from adultery would die. David's repentance was immediate and genuine: 'I have sinned against the LORD.' Nathan assured him of forgiveness—he would not die—but consequences remained.

David found out she was married to Uriah, one of his best soldiers who was away fighting. Even though David knew it was wrong, he sent for Bathsheba and sinned with her. Soon Bathsheba sent David a message: she was going to have a baby. David got scared. He didn't want anyone to know what he had done. So he tried to trick Uriah by calling him home from the war, thinking Uriah would spend time with his wife. But Uriah was such a good and honest soldier that he wouldn't go home while his friends were still fighting. David's heart got even darker. He sent Uriah back to battle with a secret letter that told the army commander to put Uriah in the most dangerous place and then leave him there alone. Uriah was killed. David married Bathsheba, thinking his secret was safe. But God knew everything. God sent a prophet named Nathan to tell David a story about a rich man who stole a poor man's only lamb. David got angry and said, 'That man should be punished!' Nathan looked right at David and said, 'You are that man! You took Uriah's wife and had him killed.' David's heart broke. He cried out, 'I have sinned against the LORD!' He was truly sorry. God forgave David, but there were still sad consequences. The baby died, and David's family had many troubles after that. David learned that sin always hurts people, but God's forgiveness is real when we truly repent."

When his conspiracy ripened, Absalom went to Hebron and proclaimed himself king. David received devastating news: 'The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.' The aging king, perhaps remembering Nathan's prophecy that evil would rise from his own house, fled Jerusalem with his household and mighty men. It was a procession of sorrow—David went up the Mount of Olives barefoot, his head covered, weeping. When told that his trusted counselor Ahithophel had joined Absalom, David prayed, 'O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.' God answered by positioning Hushai as a counter-spy in Absalom's court. Ahithophel counseled immediate pursuit of David while he was weary; Hushai advised gathering all Israel for overwhelming force. Absalom chose Hushai's flattering but foolish counsel, giving David time to cross Jordan and prepare. The battle came in the wood of Ephraim. David commanded his captains, 'Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.' But when Absalom's mule passed under a thick oak, his abundant hair caught in the branches, leaving him suspended between heaven and earth. Joab, despite David's orders, thrust three darts through Absalom's heart. News of victory brought David no joy.

Your problem is important, but the king is too busy to see you.' He did this for four years, and slowly the people started to like Absalom more than King David. Finally, Absalom declared himself king in another city! When David heard the news, his heart broke. His own son was trying to take his kingdom! David had to run away from Jerusalem to save his life. He and his loyal friends walked out of the city, and David was crying. He walked barefoot up the mountain with his head covered in sadness. Some people stayed loyal to David and helped him. A wise man named Hushai pretended to join Absalom but was really a spy for David. Absalom had an advisor named Ahithophel who gave good advice—he said, 'Chase David now while he's tired!' But Hushai gave different advice: 'Wait and gather a huge army first.' Absalom listened to Hushai, which gave David time to get ready. Soon there was a big battle. David told his soldiers, 'Please don't hurt Absalom. He's still my son.' But during the battle, Absalom was riding his mule under a tree when his long, thick hair got caught in the branches! He was hanging there when Joab, David's general, found him and killed him. When David heard that Absalom was dead, he didn't celebrate winning. Instead, he cried and cried. 'O my son Absalom! I wish I had died instead of you!' David's heart was completely broken."

David had been a man of war; Solomon, whose name means 'peace,' would build in peace. Solomon contracted with Hiram, king of Tyre, for cedar and cypress timber from Lebanon, and conscripted laborers—30,000 sent to Lebanon in shifts, plus 70,000 burden-bearers and 80,000 stonecutters. The temple's dimensions were precise: sixty cubits long, twenty wide, thirty high, overlaid within with pure gold. Great stones were prepared at the quarry, 'so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.' After seven years, the house was finished—a structure of breathtaking beauty with carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, all covered with gold. Hiram of Tyre, a master craftsman, created two bronze pillars (Jachin and Boaz), the molten sea resting on twelve bronze oxen, and all the vessels of service. When the temple stood complete, Solomon assembled all Israel for dedication. The priests brought the ark of the covenant into the Holy of Holies, beneath the overshadowing cherubim. When they emerged, 'the cloud filled the house of the LORD, so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house.' Solomon blessed the congregation and prayed a magnificent dedicatory prayer, acknowledging that 'heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded.' He besought God to hear prayers made toward this place, whether by Israel or by foreigners, asking forgiveness for sin and deliverance from enemies. God appeared to Solomon, promising, 'I have hallowed this house... mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.' The temple stood as the center of Israel's worship until Nebuchadnezzar's destruction, a symbol of God dwelling among His people.",

Your son Solomon will build my temple instead.' So when Solomon became king, he started the biggest building project ever! Solomon asked King Hiram from a nearby country to send cedar trees from Lebanon—the best, strongest, most beautiful wood in the world. He hired 30,000 men to cut trees, 70,000 men to carry supplies, and 80,000 men to cut huge stones from the mountains. The stones were cut so perfectly at the quarry that when workers put them together at the temple site, they didn't even need hammers! The temple was quiet as it went up, piece by piece. It took seven years to build. The temple was absolutely magnificent! It was ninety feet long, thirty feet wide, and forty-five feet tall. Inside, everything was covered with pure gold—the walls, the ceiling, even the floor! Artists carved pictures of angels, palm trees, and flowers into the wood, then covered it all with gold. It sparkled and shone! The most special room was the Holy of Holies, where the ark of the covenant would go—the golden box that held the Ten Commandments. When everything was finally finished, Solomon invited all the people of Israel to come for a huge celebration. The priests carefully carried the ark into the Holy of Holies. Then something amazing happened! A cloud filled the whole temple—it was the glory of God! The cloud was so thick and bright that the priests had to stop what they were doing and step back. God's presence was so powerful! Solomon prayed a beautiful prayer and said, 'Not even the biggest heaven can contain you, God, but please be specially present in this temple.' God was pleased with Solomon's temple. It became the most important place in all of Israel!"

      "narrative": "Solomon's glory came at a price—heavy taxation and forced labor that burdened the people. When Solomon died, his son Rehoboam journeyed to Shechem, where all Israel gathered to make him king. Jeroboam, Solomon's former servant who had fled to Egypt after a prophet promised him ten tribes, returned to lead the delegation. Their petition was reasonable: 'Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.' Rehoboam requested three days to consider. He first consulted the old men who had advised Solomon. Their counsel was wise: 'If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.' Servant leadership would secure the kingdom. But Rehoboam forsook this wisdom and turned to the young men who had grown up with him, companions of privilege who knew nothing of the people's burdens. Their counsel dripped with arrogance: 'Thus shalt thou speak unto this people... My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins. And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.' When Rehoboam delivered this harsh answer, the northern tribes rebelled: 'What portion have we in David?' They made Jeroboam their king over Israel, leaving only Judah and Benjamin loyal to David's house. Rehoboam assembled 180,000 warriors to restore the kingdom by force, but God sent Shemaiah the prophet: 'Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren... for this thing is from me.' The division fulfilled God's word to Solomon: because of his idolatry, the kingdom would be torn from his son. Thus began a tragic chapter—two kingdoms where God intended one, a division that would last until both fell to foreign conquerors, Israel to Assyria, Judah to Babylon.",

      "kids_narrative": "When King Solomon died, his son Rehoboam was supposed to become the next king. But first, all the people came to meet him in a city called Shechem. They had something important to ask him. A man named Jeroboam spoke for all the people: 'Your father, King Solomon, made us work very hard. He made us pay a lot of taxes and forced us to do hard jobs building his cities and palaces. If you promise to be kinder and not make life so hard for us, we will gladly serve you as our king.' This seemed like a fair request! Rehoboam said, 'Give me three days to think about it.' First, he asked the wise old men who had helped his father Solomon. They said, 'This is your chance to be a good king! If you're kind to the people and treat them well, they'll love you and serve you forever. Make their lives easier!' That was great advice! But Rehoboam didn't like it. So he asked his friends, the young men he grew up with. They had never done hard work in their lives, and they didn't care about regular people. They said, 'Don't be weak! Tell them you're going to be even tougher than your father! Tell them, \"My father was hard on you, but I'm going to be much worse! My father punished you with whips, but I'll punish you with scorpions!\"' Rehoboam thought that sounded strong and powerful. When the people came back three days later, Rehoboam gave them the mean answer. The people were shocked and angry! Ten of the twelve tribes of Israel said, 'If that's how you're going to treat us, we won't follow you! We'll get our own king!' They chose Jeroboam to be their king instead. Only two tribes stayed with Rehoboam. The kingdom of Israel split into two kingdoms that day—Israel in the north and Judah in the south. They never joined back together again. All because of one foolish, prideful decision!"
