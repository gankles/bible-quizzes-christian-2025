      "narrative": "The word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amittai: 'Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before Me.'\n\nBut Jonah ran away from the Lord. Nineveh was Israel's enemy—a brutal, pagan empire that had oppressed God's people. How could God ask him to warn them of judgment? Might they repent and receive mercy? Jonah would have none of it. Instead of heading northeast to Nineveh, he went to Joppa and found a ship bound for Tarshish—the opposite direction, as far west as he could go.\n\nHe paid the fare and went aboard, hoping to flee from the presence of the Lord. But can anyone hide from God? The Lord sent a violent wind upon the sea, and such a great storm arose that the ship threatened to break apart.\n\nThe sailors were terrified. Each cried out to his own god and threw cargo overboard to lighten the ship. But Jonah had gone below deck, lay down, and fallen into a deep sleep.\n\nThe captain found him. 'How can you sleep? Get up and call on your god! Perhaps he will take notice of us so that we will not perish!'\n\nThe sailors cast lots to discover who had brought this calamity upon them, and the lot fell on Jonah. 'Tell us,' they demanded, 'what have you done?'\n\nJonah confessed: 'I am a Hebrew, and I worship the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land. I am running away from Him.'\n\nThe men were even more terrified. 'What should we do to you to make the sea calm?'\n\n'Pick me up and throw me into the sea,' Jonah said, 'and it will become calm. I know it is my fault this great storm has come upon you.'\n\nThe sailors didn't want to do it. They rowed hard to reach land, but they couldn't. The storm grew worse. Finally, they cried out to the Lord, 'Please do not let us die for taking this man's life!' They threw Jonah overboard, and immediately the sea grew calm.\n\nThe sailors were filled with awe. They offered sacrifices to the Lord and made vows to Him.\n\nBut the Lord had not finished with His prophet. He provided a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the fish three days and three nights—entombed in darkness, yet preserved by God's mercy, given time to reflect on his rebellion.",

The people in Nineveh were mean! They were enemies! 'I'm not going!' Jonah said. So he ran away. He got on a boat going the OPPOSITE way—as far from Nineveh as he could get!\n\nJonah thought he could hide from God. But you can't hide from God! God is everywhere!\n\nGod sent a BIG storm! The wind blew WHOOOOSH! The waves crashed SPLASH! The boat rocked back and forth. The sailors were scared!\n\n'Someone on this boat made God angry!' they said. They figured out it was Jonah.\n\n'It's my fault,' Jonah admitted. 'I'm running away from God. Throw me into the water and the storm will stop.'\n\nThe sailors didn't want to, but the storm was getting worse. Finally, they threw Jonah—SPLASH—into the water!\n\nRight away, the storm stopped. Everything was calm.\n\nBut Jonah didn't drown! God sent a HUGE fish—bigger than a school bus! The fish swallowed Jonah GULP! Jonah was inside the fish's belly for three days and three nights.\n\nIt was dark and smelly in there! Jonah had a lot of time to think about running away from God."

      "characters": ["Jonah", "God"],
      "narrative": "From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the Lord his God. It was a prayer born of desperation and yet filled with faith—a song of deliverance sung even before deliverance came.\n\n'In my distress I called to the Lord, and He answered me. From deep in the realm of the dead I called for help, and You listened to my cry.'\n\nJonah described his descent: cast into the deep, into the very heart of the seas, with currents swirling about him and all God's waves sweeping over him. He thought he had been banished from God's sight, yet even then he hoped to look again upon the Lord's holy temple.\n\nThe waters had engulfed him to the point of death. Seaweed was wrapped around his head. He sank to the roots of the mountains—the very foundations of the earth. Yet the Lord brought his life up from the pit.\n\n'When my life was ebbing away, I remembered You, Lord, and my prayer rose to You, to Your holy temple.'\n\nJonah contrasted his faith with the idolatry of others: 'Those who cling to worthless idols turn away from God's love for them.' But he would not make that mistake again. 'But I, with shouts of grateful praise, will sacrifice to You. What I have vowed I will make good.'\n\nThen came the declaration of faith that summarized everything: 'Salvation comes from the Lord.'\n\nNot from running away. Not from self-determination. Not from refusing God's call. Salvation—deliverance, rescue, redemption—belongs to the Lord alone. Jonah had learned this truth in the most unlikely of classrooms: the belly of a great fish in the depths of the sea.\n\nThe Lord heard Jonah's prayer. He spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land. The prophet emerged, given a second chance to obey, covered in God's mercy despite his rebellion. God's compassion extended even to a disobedient prophet who would rather die than see his enemies saved.",

      "kids_narrative": "Inside the fish's belly, it was dark and wet and stinky. Jonah couldn't get out!\n\nFinally, Jonah did something he should have done from the beginning: he talked to God!\n\n'God, I need Your help!' Jonah prayed. 'I'm in big trouble! The water was all around me. I was sinking down, down, down. I thought I was going to die!'\n\nJonah told God he was sorry for running away. 'I should have listened to You,' he prayed. 'Please save me!'\n\nJonah remembered all the good things about God. Even in the fish's belly, he thanked God!\n\n'You are the only one who can save me,' Jonah prayed. 'I promise I'll obey You this time!'\n\nGuess what? God heard Jonah's prayer! God ALWAYS hears us when we pray, even when we're in trouble because we made bad choices.\n\nGod talked to the fish. The fish swam toward the beach. When it got close to the sand—BLEEEECH!—the fish spit Jonah out onto dry land!\n\nJonah was free! He was wet and smelly, but he was safe! God had saved him!\n\nGod gave Jonah another chance to obey. That's what mercy means—God gives us another chance even when we mess up!"

      "characters": ["Jonah", "God", "The King of Nineveh", "People of Nineveh"],
      "narrative": "The word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time: 'Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.'\n\nThis time Jonah obeyed. He went to Nineveh, and it was indeed a great city—so vast it took three days to walk through it. Jonah began by going one day's journey into the city, proclaiming: 'Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown!'\n\nIt was a simple message. No elaborate theology. No rhetorical flourishes. Just a plain warning of impending judgment. Jonah may have delivered it reluctantly, perhaps even hoping these pagans would reject it so God's judgment would fall.\n\nBut something unexpected happened. The Ninevites believed God.\n\nA fast was proclaimed, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth—the traditional garment of mourning and repentance. When word reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat down in the dust.\n\nThe king issued a decree: 'Do not let people or animals, herds or flocks, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink. But let people and animals be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence. Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from His fierce anger so that we will not perish.'\n\nHere was genuine repentance. They didn't presume on God's mercy, yet they hoped in it. They didn't know if He would spare them, but they turned from their wickedness anyway.\n\nGod saw what they did—how they turned from their evil ways. And God relented. He had compassion on them and did not bring the destruction He had threatened.\n\nThis was the gospel before the gospel: that God's mercy extends beyond Israel to all nations who turn to Him. Nineveh's repentance foreshadowed a day when people from every tribe and tongue would be called into God's kingdom. The missionary heart of God was beating even in the Old Testament, reaching out to brutal pagans through a reluctant Hebrew prophet.",

It was HUGE—it would take three whole days to walk through it!\n\nJonah walked into the city and shouted God's message: 'In forty days, God is going to destroy this city because you've been doing bad things!'\n\nJonah probably thought the people would laugh at him or get mad. But something amazing happened!\n\nThe people LISTENED! They believed Jonah's message was from God. They were very, very sorry for all the mean and bad things they had done.\n\nEveryone put on scratchy, uncomfortable clothes called sackcloth to show they were sad about their sins. Even the KING took off his fancy crown and royal robes and put on sackcloth!\n\nThe king made a rule: 'Everyone stop eating! Pray to God! Stop doing bad things! Maybe God will forgive us!'\n\nEven the animals wore sackcloth! Can you imagine cows and horses wearing scratchy clothes? The whole city was saying sorry to God!\n\nGod saw that they really meant it. They weren't just pretending. They really wanted to change and do what was right.\n\nSo God decided NOT to destroy the city! He forgave them! God's mercy is SO big that He forgives anyone who is truly sorry—even people who had been very, very bad.\n\nGod loves ALL people, everywhere!"

      "narrative": "Jonah was greatly displeased and became angry. This was exactly what he had feared—that God would relent and show mercy to Israel's enemies.\n\nHe prayed to the Lord, 'Isn't this what I said when I was still at home? That is what I tried to forestall by fleeing to Tarshish. I knew that You are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from sending calamity.'\n\nJonah quoted orthodox theology—words that should bring comfort—but he spoke them as a complaint. He knew God's character, and that's precisely why he ran. He didn't want these pagans to receive mercy.\n\n'Now, Lord, take away my life, for it is better for me to die than to live.'\n\nThe Lord replied, 'Is it right for you to be angry?'\n\nJonah went out and sat east of the city, making himself a shelter to see what would happen. Perhaps he still hoped God would destroy Nineveh.\n\nThe Lord provided a leafy plant that grew up over Jonah to give shade and ease his discomfort. Jonah was very happy about the plant. But at dawn the next day, God provided a worm that chewed the plant so that it withered. When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind. The sun blazed on Jonah's head until he grew faint and wanted to die.\n\n'It would be better for me to die than to live,' he said.\n\nGod asked, 'Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?'\n\n'It is,' Jonah said. 'And I'm so angry I wish I were dead.'\n\nThen the Lord said, 'You have been concerned about this plant, though you did not tend it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight and died overnight. And should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left—and also many animals?'\n\nThe book ends with God's question hanging in the air. Jonah had compassion for a plant but not for thousands of souls. He mourned shade but rejoiced at the thought of mass destruction. His nationalism had eclipsed his theology. He served a God whose mercy extended to all nations, yet he wanted that mercy restricted to his own people.\n\nGod's final words reveal His heart: compassion for the multitudes who live in spiritual darkness, concern even for the animals. The same God who saved eight people and animals in Noah's ark had compassion on 120,000 people and many animals in Nineveh. His mercy knows no ethnic boundaries. His love extends to all who turn to Him, foreshadowing the day when His gospel would go to the ends of the earth.",

      "kids_narrative": "You'd think Jonah would be happy that the people were saved, right? But Jonah was MAD!\n\n'This is exactly why I ran away!' Jonah complained to God. 'I KNEW You would forgive them! I don't WANT You to be nice to these bad people!'\n\nJonah was so angry he said, 'I wish I were dead!'\n\nGod asked, 'Jonah, should you be angry?'\n\nJonah went outside the city and sat down to pout. It was very hot. So God made a big leafy plant grow up to give Jonah shade.\n\nJonah was SO happy about the plant! 'Ahhhh, nice and cool!'\n\nBut the next day, God sent a little worm. The worm ate the plant, and it died. Now the hot sun beat down on Jonah again. He was sweating and grumpy.\n\n'I'm so angry about my plant!' Jonah said. 'I wish I were dead!'\n\nThen God asked Jonah an important question: 'Jonah, you're upset about a plant that you didn't make, that only lived for one day. But you don't care about thousands and thousands of people in Nineveh? Those people didn't know about Me. Shouldn't I care about them? Shouldn't I want to save them?'\n\nGod was teaching Jonah that He loves ALL people—not just some people. God wants EVERYONE to know Him and be saved!\n\nGod's love is bigger than we can imagine. He loves people from every country, every city, everywhere in the world. And He wants us to love them too!"
