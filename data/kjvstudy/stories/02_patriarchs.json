'Leave your country, your people, and your father's household,' the Lord commanded, 'and go to the land I will show you.'\n\nGod made promises that seemed impossible: 'I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you. I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you, and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.'\n\nAbram was seventy-five years old, childless, and being asked to leave everything familiar for an unknown destination. Yet Scripture records simply: 'So Abram went, as the Lord had told him.'\n\nHe took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all their possessions, and the people they had acquired in Haran. They set out for the land of Canaan, and when they arrived, the Lord appeared to Abram again. 'To your offspring I will give this land.'\n\nAbram built an altar there to the Lord who had appeared to him. Then he moved on, pitching his tent between Bethel and Ai, where he built another altar and called on the name of the Lord.\n\nThis was the beginning of everything—the call that would lead to the nation of Israel, the promised Messiah, and blessing for all nations. It started with one man willing to trust God and go.",

It might be scary!\n\nBut God made Abraham some big promises. 'I will make your family into a great nation. I will bless you. Through your family, everyone in the whole world will be blessed!'\n\nAbraham trusted God. Even though he didn't know where he was going, he packed up everything and went! His wife Sarah went too.\n\nThey traveled and traveled until they came to a beautiful land called Canaan. God said, 'This is the land I'm giving to your family!'\n\nAbraham was so thankful! He built a special pile of stones called an altar to worship God.\n\nAbraham didn't have any children yet. How could his family become a great nation? But Abraham believed God would keep His promise.

The land could not support both of them together; their possessions were so great that they could not stay in the same place.\n\nQuarreling broke out between Abraham's herdsmen and Lot's herdsmen. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land, watching.\n\nAbraham, though older and having the right to choose first, took a different approach. 'Let's not have any quarreling between us, or between our herdsmen,' he said to Lot. 'We are family. The whole land is before you. If you go to the left, I'll go to the right; if you go to the right, I'll go to the left.'\n\nLot looked up and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan was well watered, like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt. He chose the whole plain for himself and set out toward the east, pitching his tents near Sodom—whose people were wicked and sinning greatly against the Lord.\n\nAfter Lot had parted from him, the Lord spoke to Abraham: 'Look around from where you are—north, south, east, and west. All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring forever. I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted.'\n\nAbraham moved his tents and went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he built another altar to the Lord.

So he had an idea. 'Lot, let's split up. You pick which direction you want to go. I'll take what's left.'\n\nLot looked around. One way, he saw beautiful green land near a river. It looked perfect! He pointed that direction. 'I want THAT land!'\n\n'Okay,' said Abraham kindly.\n\nLot took his animals and moved to the nice green land near a city called Sodom. But the people in Sodom were very bad. That wasn't a good choice.\n\nAfter Lot left, God spoke to Abraham. 'Look all around you! I'm giving ALL this land to you and your family forever. Your family will be as many as the specks of dust on the ground!'\n\nAbraham was kind and let Lot choose first. And God took care of Abraham anyway!

'Will You also destroy the righteous with the wicked?' Abraham asked boldly. He bargained with God, asking if fifty righteous people lived in the city, would He spare it? The LORD agreed. Abraham continued, reducing the number to forty-five, then forty, thirty, twenty, and finally ten. Each time, God promised to spare the city for the sake of the righteous.\n\nThat evening, two angels arrived in Sodom and found Lot sitting in the city gate. Lot insisted they stay at his house rather than spend the night in the city square. Before they retired for the night, the men of Sodom surrounded Lot's house, demanding he bring out his guests so they could abuse them. The angels struck the mob with blindness and pulled Lot back inside.\n\nThe angels urged Lot to gather his family and flee, for the LORD was about to destroy the city. Lot warned his sons-in-law, but they thought he was joking. As dawn broke, the angels seized Lot, his wife, and his two daughters by the hands and led them out. 'Flee for your lives!' the angels commanded. 'Don't look back!'\n\nAs the sun rose and Lot reached Zoar, the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah. He overthrew those cities and the entire plain, destroying all who lived there. But Lot's wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.\n\nEarly the next morning, Abraham looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.

Abraham's nephew Lot lived in Sodom, so Abraham was worried. He asked God bravely, 'What if there are fifty good people in the city? Will you still destroy it?' God said no, He would spare it for fifty. Abraham kept asking—what about forty-five? Thirty? Twenty? Ten? Each time, God agreed He would save the city if that many good people lived there.\n\nThat same evening, two angels went to Sodom and met Lot at the city gate. Lot invited them to stay at his house. But the wicked men of Sodom surrounded Lot's house and wanted to hurt the angels! The angels struck the bad men with blindness so they couldn't find the door. Then the angels told Lot, 'Get your family and run! God is going to destroy this city tomorrow!'\n\nWhen morning came, the angels grabbed Lot, his wife, and his two daughters by the hands and rushed them out of the city. 'Run for your lives!' the angels shouted. 'Don't look back!'\n\nJust as the sun came up and Lot reached the small city of Zoar, fire and burning sulfur rained down from the sky onto Sodom and Gomorrah! The cities were completely destroyed. But here's the sad part—Lot's wife didn't obey. She looked back at the burning cities, even though the angels told her not to, and she turned into a pillar of salt right there!\n\nThis story teaches us important lessons. God always keeps His promises—both to punish wickedness and to save people who trust Him. We should obey God right away, even when it's hard. And prayer is powerful! Abraham's prayer helped save Lot."

Abraham was determined that Isaac not marry a Canaanite woman, so he sent his chief servant to Abraham's own country and kindred to find a wife for Isaac.\n\nThe servant took ten camels loaded with good things and set out. He arrived at a well outside the town in the evening, the time when women go out to draw water. The servant prayed specifically for God's guidance, asking that the young woman who would offer him water and also water his camels would be the one the LORD had chosen for Isaac.\n\nBefore he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar. She was very beautiful. The servant asked for a drink, and she quickly gave him one. Then she said, 'I'll draw water for your camels too, until they have had enough to drink.' She ran back and forth, filling the trough until all ten thirsty camels had drunk their fill.\n\nThe servant gave her golden jewelry and asked whose daughter she was. When he learned she was Abraham's great-niece, he bowed down and worshiped the LORD, saying, 'Praise be to the LORD, who has led me on the journey to the house of my master's relatives!'\n\nWhen Rebekah's family heard how God had clearly guided the servant, they agreed that Rebekah should go. The next morning, when they asked Rebekah, 'Will you go with this man?' she replied, 'I will go.'\n\nIsaac was living in the Negev. One evening he went out to the field to meditate, and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching. Rebekah saw Isaac and covered herself. The servant told Isaac all he had done.

So Abraham called his most trusted servant and said, 'Travel back to the land where I grew up and find a wife for Isaac there.'\n\nWhen the servant arrived at a well, he knew he needed God's help. He prayed an amazing prayer: 'LORD, when I ask a young woman for a drink, let the right one say, \"Yes, and I'll also get water for all your camels!\" That's how I'll know she's the one You've chosen for Isaac.'\n\nBefore the servant even finished praying, a beautiful young woman named Rebekah came to the well. The servant asked, 'Please give me a little water.' Rebekah immediately said, 'Of course! Drink, sir!' But then she said something that made the servant's heart jump: 'I'll draw water for your camels, too, until they've had enough!' She ran back and forth until all ten thirsty camels had drunk their fill. The servant watched in amazement—God had answered his prayer exactly!\n\nThe servant gave Rebekah beautiful golden jewelry and asked who her family was. When he found out she was Abraham's great-niece, he bowed down and thanked God! Rebekah ran home to tell her family.\n\nThe servant explained his whole mission and how God had answered his prayer through Rebekah. Her family could see that God was in this plan, so they asked Rebekah, 'Will you go with this man to marry Isaac?' Rebekah bravely said, 'I will go!' The very next day, they began the journey back to where Isaac lived.\n\nThis wonderful story teaches us that we can pray very specific prayers and God hears us. When we're kind and helpful like Rebekah, God can use our good character to fulfill His plans!"

Through this miracle baby, all the nations of the earth would be blessed.\n\nAbraham circumcised Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded.

Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.'\n\nHow could this be? Isaac was the promised son, the heir of the covenant, the fulfillment of everything God had said. Yet Abraham did not argue or delay. Early the next morning, he saddled his donkey, took two servants and Isaac, cut wood for the burnt offering, and set out.\n\nOn the third day, Abraham saw the place in the distance. 'Stay here with the donkey,' he told his servants. 'The boy and I will go over there and worship, and then we will come back to you.' We—did Abraham believe God would raise Isaac from the dead? The writer of Hebrews says yes.\n\nAs they walked together, Isaac spoke: 'Father? The fire and wood are here, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?'\n\nAbraham answered, 'God himself will provide the lamb, my son.'\n\nWhen they reached the place, Abraham built an altar, arranged the wood, bound his son Isaac, and laid him on the altar atop the wood.

      "narrative": "Twenty years had passed. Jacob had worked for Laban, married Leah and Rachel, fathered eleven sons and a daughter, and acquired great wealth. Now God told him to return home.\n\nBut home meant facing Esau. Jacob sent messengers ahead, who returned with terrifying news: 'Esau is coming to meet you with four hundred men.'\n\nJacob was in great fear and distress. He divided his people and flocks into groups, hoping some might escape if attacked. He prayed, reminding God of His promises. He sent wave after wave of gifts ahead to appease his brother.\n\nThat night, Jacob sent his family across the ford of the Jabbok River. Then he was left alone.\n\nA man appeared and wrestled with him till daybreak. When the man saw he could not overpower Jacob, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip, wrenching it. Yet Jacob held on.\n\n'Let me go,' the man said, 'for it is daybreak.'\n\n'I will not let you go unless you bless me,' Jacob gasped.\n\n'What is your name?'\n\n'Jacob.' The name meant deceiver, heel-grabber, supplanter.\n\n'Your name will no longer be Jacob,' the man declared. 'It will be Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.'\n\nJacob asked, 'Please tell me your name.'\n\n'Why do you ask my name?' And he blessed Jacob there.\n\nJacob named the place Peniel, meaning 'face of God,' saying, 'I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.'\n\nThe sun rose as he crossed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip. The deceiver had become Israel—'he struggles with God.' He would carry the limp for the rest of his life, a permanent reminder of the night he wrestled with the Almighty and prevailed through persistence rather than trickery.",

He grabbed Jacob and they started wrestling. They wrestled ALL night long! Jacob wouldn't give up.\n\nAs the sun started to come up, the man touched Jacob's hip and hurt it. But still Jacob held on!\n\n'Let me go!' said the man.\n\n'No!' said Jacob. 'Not until you bless me!'\n\n'What is your name?' the man asked.\n\n'Jacob.' That name meant 'tricky one.'\n\n'Not anymore,' said the man. 'Your new name is ISRAEL. It means you struggled with God and won! You didn't give up.'\n\nThen Jacob understood. He had been wrestling with GOD! 'I saw God face to face!' Jacob said in amazement.\n\nThe sun came up and Jacob walked away with a limp. His hip hurt from the wrestling. But he had a new name and a new life.\n\nJacob used to get things by tricking people. But that night, he learned to hold on to God and not let go. God changed him from Jacob the trickster into Israel, the father of a whole nation!"

'Listen to this dream I had,' he said. 'We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.'\n\n'Do you intend to reign over us?' his brothers demanded. 'Will you actually rule us?' And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said.\n\nThen Joseph had another dream. 'Listen,' he said, 'I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.'\n\nWhen he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him. 'What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?' His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.\n\nJoseph was seventeen, young and perhaps unwise in sharing his dreams so openly.

They were so jealous they couldn't even say anything nice to Joseph.\n\nThen Joseph had a dream. He told his brothers about it. 'We were all tying up bundles of wheat in a field. My bundle stood up straight, and all YOUR bundles bowed down to mine!'\n\nHis brothers were angry. 'Do you think you're going to be our KING? You think WE'LL bow to YOU?' They hated him even more.\n\nJoseph had another dream. 'This time the sun, moon, and eleven stars all bowed down to me!'\n\nEven his dad said, 'Joseph! What kind of dream is that? Do you think your mom and I and all your brothers will bow to you?'\n\nHis brothers were so jealous. But his dad wondered about those dreams.\n\nJoseph was just a teenager.

When they saw him in the distance, before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.\n\n'Here comes that dreamer!' they said. 'Let's kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say a wild animal devoured him. Then we'll see what comes of his dreams.'\n\nReuben, the oldest, persuaded them not to shed blood. 'Throw him into this cistern in the wilderness, but don't lay a hand on him.' He planned to rescue Joseph later. So when Joseph arrived, they stripped off his beautiful robe and threw him into an empty cistern.\n\nAs they sat down to eat, a caravan of Ishmaelite merchants appeared, heading for Egypt. Judah suggested, 'What will we gain if we kill our brother? Let's sell him instead.' They pulled Joseph out of the cistern and sold him for twenty pieces of silver.\n\nWhen Reuben returned to the cistern and found Joseph gone, he tore his clothes in grief. But the deed was done.\n\nThe brothers slaughtered a goat and dipped Joseph's robe in its blood. They brought it to their father. 'We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son's robe.'\n\nJacob recognized it immediately. 'It is my son's robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.' He tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourned for his son many days. All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. 'I will continue to mourn until I join my son in the grave,' he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard.

Joseph was scared and alone in the dark pit.\n\nWhile the brothers ate lunch, they saw some traveling merchants heading to Egypt. One brother had an idea. 'Let's sell Joseph to them instead of hurting him. We'll get money, and he'll be gone forever!'\n\nThey pulled Joseph out of the pit and sold him—their own brother!—for twenty pieces of silver. The merchants took Joseph away to Egypt, far, far from home.\n\nNow the brothers had to fool their father. They killed a goat and put the blood on Joseph's colorful coat. They brought it to Jacob.\n\n'We found this,' they said. 'Is it Joseph's coat?'\n\nJacob saw the blood and cried, 'Joseph is dead! A wild animal killed my son!' He was SO sad. He cried and cried for a long, long time.\n\nThe brothers' terrible lie hurt everyone. Joseph was a slave in a strange land. Jacob's heart was broken.\n\nBut God hadn't forgotten Joseph.

But his brothers could not answer him, because they were terrified.\n\n'Come close to me,' Joseph said. When they did, he continued, 'I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt! And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.'\n\nJoseph explained: 'For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will be no plowing or reaping. But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God.'\n\nHe embraced his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept on his shoulder. Then he kissed all his brothers and wept over them. Afterward his brothers talked with him.\n\nPharaoh was pleased and said to Joseph, 'Tell your brothers to load their animals and go back to Canaan. Bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt.'\n\nSo Joseph sent his brothers back with carts, provisions, and new clothes—five sets for Benjamin, along with three hundred shekels of silver.

He took Joseph and put him in prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined.\n\nBut the Lord was with Joseph there too and showed him kindness. He granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden. Soon the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there. The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph's care, because the Lord was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did.\n\nSome time later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, and Pharaoh put them in custody in the same prison where Joseph was confined. They were there for some time, and Joseph attended them.\n\nOne night, each of the two men had a dream. When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were dejected.

Tell me your dreams.'\n\nThe chief cupbearer told his dream: 'In my dream I saw a vine with three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes. Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into the cup, and put it in his hand.'\n\nJoseph said, 'The three branches are three days. Within three days Pharaoh will restore you to your position. But when all goes well with you, remember me and show kindness to me; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison.'\n\nThe chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, so he said, 'In my dream there were three baskets of bread on my head. Birds were eating out of the basket on my head.'\n\nJoseph said, 'The three baskets are three days. Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and impale your body on a pole.'\n\nOn the third day, Pharaoh's birthday, he gave a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. He restored the cupbearer to his position, but he impaled the baker—just as Joseph had interpreted.\n\nThe chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.

I squeezed the grapes into the king's cup and gave it to him.'\n\nJoseph said, 'Good news! The three branches mean three days. In three days, the king will give you your job back!'\n\nThe baker was excited. 'In MY dream, I had three baskets of bread on my head, but birds ate the bread.'\n\nJoseph's face got serious.

Then seven full ears of grain were consumed by seven thin, withered ears. When Egypt's magicians and wise men could not interpret these visions, the chief butler finally remembered Joseph. Hastily brought from the dungeon, Joseph stood before the most powerful man in the ancient world. When Pharaoh recounted his dreams, Joseph gave God the glory: 'It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.' The interpretation was sobering—seven years of abundant harvest would be followed by seven years of severe famine. But Joseph went beyond interpretation to offer divinely inspired counsel: appoint a wise overseer to gather one-fifth of Egypt's harvest during the plenty, storing it against the coming famine. Pharaoh recognized God's Spirit in Joseph and declared, 'Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?' At age thirty, Joseph was elevated from prisoner to prime minister, given Pharaoh's signet ring, fine linen, and a gold chain. He received a new name, Zaphnath-paaneah, and married Asenath, daughter of an Egyptian priest. During the seven plenteous years, Joseph gathered grain 'as the sand of the sea' until it was beyond measure. When famine struck, not only Egypt but all surrounding nations came to Joseph for sustenance. The dreamer had become the dream's fulfillment, the rejected brother now held the power of life and death over nations.

Then seven skinny, ugly cows came and ate up the fat cows! In the second dream, seven full ears of corn grew on one stalk. Then seven thin, dried-up ears of corn ate the good ones. Pharaoh woke up worried. He called all the wise men in Egypt, but nobody could tell him what the dreams meant. That's when the butler remembered Joseph! He told Pharaoh about the young Hebrew man in prison who could explain dreams. Pharaoh sent for Joseph right away. Joseph cleaned up, shaved, and put on fresh clothes. When he stood before Pharaoh, he said something very important: 'I can't interpret dreams, but God can!' Joseph explained that both dreams meant the same thing. Egypt would have seven years of really good harvests with lots of food. But then seven years of terrible famine would come with no food at all. Joseph told Pharaoh to find a wise man to save up food during the good years so people wouldn't starve during the bad years. Pharaoh was so impressed that he said, 'You're the wisest man for the job!' He put his own ring on Joseph's finger, dressed him in fancy clothes, and made him the second most important person in all Egypt. Joseph went from prisoner to prince in one day! Just like God promised, everything happened exactly as Joseph said it would."
