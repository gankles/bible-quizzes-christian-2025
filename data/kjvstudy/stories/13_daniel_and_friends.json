      "narrative": "In the third year of King Jehoiakim's reign, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon besieged Jerusalem. The Lord delivered Jehoiakim into his hand, and Nebuchadnezzar carried off vessels from God's temple to Babylon, placing them in the treasury of his god.\n\nThe king ordered Ashpenaz, chief of his court officials, to bring in young men from Israel's royal family and nobility—young men without physical defect, handsome, showing aptitude for learning, well informed, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king's palace. They were to be taught the language and literature of the Babylonians for three years, after which they would enter the king's service.\n\nAmong these were four young men from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. The chief official gave them Babylonian names—Daniel became Belteshazzar, Hananiah became Shadrach, Mishael became Meshach, and Azariah became Abednego. They could take away their Hebrew names, but they could not take away their Hebrew faith.\n\nThe king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from his own table. But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine. This was not mere dietary preference—the food had likely been offered to idols, and eating it would compromise their covenant with God. Daniel asked permission not to defile himself.\n\nGod caused the official to show favor and compassion to Daniel, but he was afraid: 'I fear my lord the king, who has assigned your food and drink. Why should he see you looking worse than the other young men? The king would then have my head!'\n\nDaniel proposed a test: 'Please test your servants for ten days: Give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink. Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food.'\n\nThe official agreed. At the end of ten days, Daniel and his friends looked healthier and better nourished than all the young men who ate the royal food. God honored their faithfulness—they did not need the king's delicacies when they had the King of Heaven's blessing.\n\nGod gave these four young men knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. Daniel could also understand visions and dreams of all kinds. At the end of three years, when they were presented to Nebuchadnezzar, he found none equal to Daniel and his friends. In every matter of wisdom and understanding, they were ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom.\n\nTheir story began in exile, stripped of home and family, but they chose to honor God. And God honored them.",

      "kids_narrative": "Daniel and his three best friends—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—lived in a place called Judah. They loved God very much. But one day, a powerful king named Nebuchadnezzar came and took them far away to his country, Babylon.\n\nThe king had a plan. He wanted to train the smartest young men to work for him. He gave them new names and said, 'You can eat food from my special table! You can have meat and wine—the best food in the kingdom!'\n\nBut Daniel had a problem. The king's food was offered to fake gods called idols. If Daniel ate it, it would be like saying those fake gods were real. Daniel wanted to obey God, not the king's idols.\n\nDaniel was brave. He told the king's helper, 'Please, can we just eat vegetables and drink water instead?'\n\nThe helper was worried. 'But what if you get sick and skinny? The king will be angry at me!'\n\nDaniel said, 'How about a test? Let us eat vegetables and water for ten days. Then see if we look healthy!'\n\nThe helper agreed. For ten days, Daniel and his friends ate their vegetables—carrots, beans, lettuce—and drank water. No fancy meat. No wine.\n\nAfter ten days, guess what? Daniel and his friends looked healthier and stronger than all the other young men who ate the king's food!\n\nGod blessed them for being faithful. He made them super smart too! When the king tested them, they were TEN TIMES smarter than all his wise men!\n\nDaniel and his friends learned that when you obey God, even when it's hard, God takes care of you!"

      "narrative": "In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had disturbing dreams that troubled his spirit. He summoned his magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed.\n\n'I have had a dream that troubles me,' the king said, 'and I want to know what it means.'\n\nThe astrologers answered, 'O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it.'\n\nBut the king replied, 'This is what I have firmly decided: If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut to pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble. But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive gifts and great honor.'\n\nThe wise men protested: 'No one can reveal what the king asks! No king has ever asked such a thing! No one can do it except the gods, and they do not dwell among mortals.'\n\nThis enraged Nebuchadnezzar. He ordered all the wise men of Babylon executed—including Daniel and his friends, though they had not been consulted. When Arioch, commander of the king's guard, came to execute them, Daniel spoke with wisdom and tact: 'Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?' Arioch explained, and Daniel went to the king and asked for time.\n\nThen Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends. They urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that they would not be executed. That night, the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision.\n\nDaniel praised God: 'Praise be to the name of God forever and ever; wisdom and power are His. He changes times and seasons; He deposes kings and raises up others. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning. He reveals deep and hidden things; He knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with Him.'\n\nDaniel told Arioch, 'Do not execute the wise men. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream.' Before Nebuchadnezzar, Daniel said, 'No wise man, enchanter, magician, or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about, but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come.'\n\nDaniel described the dream: a great statue with a head of gold, chest and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. A rock cut out, but not by human hands, struck the statue's feet and shattered it. The rock became a great mountain that filled the whole earth.\n\nThe interpretation: The statue represented successive kingdoms—Babylon was the head of gold, followed by lesser kingdoms. But the God of heaven would set up a kingdom that would never be destroyed, crushing all other kingdoms and enduring forever.\n\nNebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and exclaimed, 'Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries!' He placed Daniel in a high position and gave gifts. At Daniel's request, he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel remained at the royal court.\n\nGod had revealed not just a dream but the entire sweep of human history—and His ultimate, unshakeable kingdom.",

He forgot what the dream was, but he knew it was important!\n\nThe king called all his wise men. 'Tell me my dream and what it means!' he demanded.\n\n'But Your Majesty,' they said, 'tell US the dream first, and we'll explain it!'\n\n'No!' the king shouted. 'If you're really so wise, you should know what I dreamed! If you can't tell me, I'll punish all of you!'\n\nThe wise men were terrified. 'That's impossible! No one can do that except the gods!'\n\nThe king got so angry that he ordered ALL the wise men in Babylon to be punished—even Daniel and his friends!\n\nWhen Daniel heard this, he asked the king, 'Please give me a little time.'

Not because I'm smart, but because there is a God in heaven who knows all mysteries!'\n\nDaniel told the king: 'You saw a huge statue! Its head was shiny gold, its chest was silver, its belly was bronze, its legs were iron, and its feet were part iron and part clay. Then a special rock—not cut by human hands—smashed the statue into tiny pieces! The rock grew into a huge mountain that filled the whole world!'\n\n'That's IT!' the king exclaimed. 'That's exactly what I dreamed! But what does it mean?'\n\nDaniel explained: 'The statue shows different kingdoms that will come and go. But God's kingdom—that special rock—will last forever! It will never be destroyed!'\n\nThe king was amazed. He bowed down and said, 'Your God is the greatest God of all!'

      "narrative": "King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, ninety feet high and nine feet wide, and set it up on the plain of Dura in Babylon. He summoned all his officials to come to its dedication. A herald proclaimed, 'As soon as you hear the music, you must fall down and worship the image. Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.'\n\nWhen the music sounded, all the people fell down and worshiped—except three young Hebrews. Some astrologers came to the king and denounced them: 'O king, you issued a decree that everyone must worship the golden image. But there are some Jews whom you have set over the province—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—who pay no attention to you. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image you have set up.'\n\nNebuchadnezzar was furious. He summoned the three men and gave them one more chance: 'Is it true that you do not serve my gods or worship the image? If you are ready to fall down and worship when you hear the music, very good. But if you do not worship, you will be thrown into the blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?'\n\nTheir answer has echoed through the centuries: 'O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter. If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to deliver us from it, and He will deliver us from your hand. But even if He does not, we want you to know that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.'\n\nEven if He does not. Their faith was not conditional on deliverance. They would obey regardless of outcome.\n\nNebuchadnezzar was filled with rage. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual. The strongest soldiers in his army bound Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and threw them into the blazing furnace. The furnace was so hot that the flames killed the soldiers who threw them in.\n\nBut then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement. 'Weren't there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?' he asked his advisers.\n\n'Certainly, O king,' they replied.\n\n'Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods!'\n\nNebuchadnezzar approached the opening of the furnace and shouted, 'Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!'\n\nThey walked out of the fire. The officials crowded around them and saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them.\n\nNebuchadnezzar declared, 'Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent His angel and rescued His servants! They trusted in Him and defied the king's command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.'

      "narrative": "King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them. While Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them.\n\nThis was not mere feasting—it was deliberate sacrilege, mocking the God of heaven by using His holy vessels for drunken revelry and praising gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.\n\nSuddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote. His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his legs became weak and his knees were knocking.\n\nThe king summoned his enchanters, astrologers, and diviners. 'Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck, and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.'\n\nBut none of the king's wise men could read the writing or tell the king what it meant. King Belshazzar became even more terrified, and his nobles were baffled.\n\nThe queen, hearing the voices, came into the banquet hall. 'There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him,' she said. 'In the time of your father he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that of the gods. Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the magicians. This man Daniel has a keen mind and knowledge and understanding. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means.'\n\nSo Daniel was brought before the king. Belshazzar said, 'Are you Daniel? I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve difficult problems. If you can read this writing and tell me what it means, you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.'\n\nDaniel answered, 'You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means.'\n\nThen Daniel gave a sermon to the king: 'O Belshazzar, you knew all this about Nebuchadnezzar. You knew how God humbled him when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride. But you have not humbled yourself, though you knew all this. Instead, you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from His temple brought to you, and you drank wine from them while praising gods of silver and gold. But you did not honor the God who holds in His hand your life and all your ways.'\n\nThen Daniel read the inscription: 'MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN.'\n\nThe interpretation: 'MENE means God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end. TEKEL means you have been weighed on the scales and found wanting. PERES means your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.'\n\nThen at Belshazzar's command, Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom.\n\nThat very night Belshazzar, king of the Babylonians, was slain, and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom.\n\nThe hand had written judgment, and judgment came swiftly.

      "narrative": "Darius the Mede decided to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom, with three administrators over them, one of whom was Daniel. Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.\n\nAt this, the other administrators and satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent.\n\nFinally these men said, 'We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God.' So they went as a group to the king and proposed a new law: 'O King Darius, live forever! All the royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers and governors have agreed that the king should issue an edict that anyone who prays to any god or man during the next thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be thrown into the lions' den. Now, O king, issue the decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be altered—in accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.'\n\nKing Darius, flattered and deceived, put the decree in writing.\n\nNow when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before.\n\nDaniel did not hide. He did not compromise. He did not even close his windows. His prayer life was not secret or sporadic—it was regular, visible, and directed toward the city of God's temple. He had been doing this for decades, and a new law would not change his faithfulness.\n\nThe officials went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help. They went to the king and reminded him of his decree. Then they said, 'Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the decree you put in writing. He still prays three times a day.'\n\nWhen the king heard this, he was greatly distressed and made every effort to rescue Daniel. He labored until sundown trying to find a way to save him. But the men reminded him: 'According to the law of the Medes and Persians, no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed.'\n\nReluctantly, the king gave the order, and Daniel was brought and thrown into the lions' den. The king said to Daniel, 'May your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!' A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it.\n\nThe king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment. At the first light of dawn, he got up and hurried to the lions' den. When he came near, he called out in an anguished voice, 'Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to rescue you from the lions?'\n\nDaniel answered, 'O king, live forever! My God sent His angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me, because I was found innocent in His sight. Nor have I ever done any wrong before you, O king.'\n\nThe king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den. When Daniel was brought up, no wound was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.\n\nAt the king's command, the men who had falsely accused Daniel were brought and thrown into the lions' den, along with their wives and children. Before they reached the floor of the den, the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.\n\nKing Darius wrote to all peoples and nations: 'I issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the God of Daniel. For He is the living God and He endures forever; His kingdom will not be destroyed, His dominion will never end. He rescues and He saves; He performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth. He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions.'\n\nSo Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian. His faithfulness had testified to two empires about the one true God.",

He had become very important—the king wanted to put him in charge of the whole kingdom!\n\nBut some other leaders were jealous. They didn't like Daniel. They wanted his job! So they tried to find something bad that Daniel did. They watched him and watched him, but they couldn't find ANYTHING wrong! Daniel was honest and good.\n\n'We'll never catch him doing anything bad,' they said, 'unless we make a law about his God!' They had a sneaky plan.\n\nThey went to King Darius and said, 'O great king! We think you should make a law: For thirty days, everyone can only pray to YOU. Anyone who prays to any other god should be thrown to the lions!'\n\nThe king thought this sounded good. He signed the law. In that kingdom, once a law was signed, it could NEVER be changed.\n\nWhen Daniel heard about the new law, do you know what he did? He went home, opened his windows toward Jerusalem, got down on his knees, and prayed to God—just like he did THREE TIMES EVERY DAY!\n\nDaniel didn't hide. He didn't stop praying. He knew that obeying God was more important than obeying a bad law.\n\nThe jealous men were watching! They ran to the king. 'King Darius! Daniel is breaking your law! He's praying to his God three times a day!'\n\nThe king was SO sad! He loved Daniel! He tried ALL day to find a way to save him. But the jealous men said, 'Remember, O king—the law can't be changed!'\n\nSo sadly, the king gave the order. Soldiers took Daniel and threw him into a deep, dark pit full of hungry LIONS! They rolled a big stone over the opening and sealed it.\n\nThe king whispered to Daniel, 'May your God rescue you!' Then he went back to his palace. He couldn't eat dinner. He couldn't sleep. He was too worried about Daniel.\n\nAs soon as the sun came up, the king RAN to the lions' den. 'Daniel!' he called out. 'Did your God save you from the lions?'\n\nAnd from inside the den came Daniel's voice: 'O king, live forever! My God sent His angel to shut the lions' mouths! They didn't hurt me at all!'\n\nThe king was so happy! He ordered his men to pull Daniel out. They looked him all over—not even a scratch! The lions hadn't touched him!\n\nThen the king threw the JEALOUS men into the lions' den. This time, the lions were NOT gentle.\n\nKing Darius wrote to the whole kingdom: 'Everyone should respect Daniel's God! He is the living God! He lasts forever! He rescued Daniel from the lions!'\n\nDaniel was safe because he trusted God. And God always protects His faithful people!"

      "narrative": "In the later years of his life, God gave Daniel profound visions that pulled back the curtain on spiritual warfare and the sweep of human history leading to God's eternal kingdom.\n\nIn the first year of Belshazzar, Daniel had a dream of four great beasts coming up from the sea—a lion with eagle's wings, a bear raised up on one side, a leopard with four wings and four heads, and a terrifying fourth beast with iron teeth and ten horns. These represented successive kingdoms that would rule the earth.\n\nBut then Daniel's vision shifted to heaven: 'Thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took His seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of His head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze. Thousands upon thousands attended Him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him.'\n\nThe fourth beast was slain, and then Daniel saw 'one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into His presence. He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and His kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.'\n\nThis Son of Man—Jesus would later use this title for Himself—would receive an eternal kingdom, in fulfillment of the rock that shattered the statue in Nebuchadnezzar's dream.\n\nIn another vision, Daniel saw a ram and a goat representing the Medo-Persian and Greek empires. The angel Gabriel appeared to interpret: 'The vision concerns the time of the end.' Gabriel explained the rise of Alexander the Great and the division of his kingdom—prophecies fulfilled with stunning precision in history.\n\nDaniel's greatest revelation came through prayer. While studying Jeremiah's prophecy of seventy years of captivity, Daniel confessed the sins of his people and pleaded for Jerusalem's restoration. Gabriel came to him: 'Seventy weeks are decreed for your people and your holy city—to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy.'\n\nThis prophecy of seventy 'weeks' (or sevens) of years pointed precisely to the coming of the Messiah, His cutting off, and the final consummation of all things.\n\nIn Daniel's final vision, he saw a man dressed in linen—likely a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ—whose appearance was glorious and terrifying. Daniel fell into a deep sleep, but the figure touched him and gave him strength. He revealed the spiritual warfare between the angelic princes of nations, with Michael the archangel fighting for Israel.\n\nThe vision concluded with prophecies of persecution, tribulation, and ultimate deliverance: 'At that time Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time your people—everyone whose name is found written in the book—will be delivered. Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt. Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.'\n\nDaniel was told to seal up the vision, for it concerned the distant future. He was promised, 'You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance.'\n\nDaniel's visions revealed that history is not random—it is the stage for the unfolding of God's eternal purposes, culminating in the triumph of the Son of Man and the resurrection of the righteous.",

      "kids_description": "God gave Daniel special dreams and visions showing what would happen in the future. He saw scary beasts, powerful angels, and God's throne room in heaven! God showed Daniel that His kingdom will last forever.",
      "kids_narrative": "When Daniel was older, God gave him amazing dreams and visions! God wanted to show Daniel what would happen in the future—not just next week or next year, but hundreds and thousands of years later!\n\nIn one dream, Daniel saw four strange beasts coming out of the ocean. There was a lion with eagle wings, a lopsided bear, a leopard with four heads, and a super scary beast with iron teeth! These beasts stood for different kingdoms that would rule the world.\n\nBut then Daniel looked up and saw something WONDERFUL! He saw God's throne room in heaven! God was sitting on a throne that was on FIRE, with wheels blazing! He was called 'the Ancient of Days' because He's been alive forever. His clothes were white as snow, and His hair was white like wool. Thousands and thousands of angels stood around Him!\n\nThen Daniel saw someone special: 'One like the Son of Man'—that's Jesus! He came to God's throne riding on the clouds. God gave Him a kingdom that would NEVER END! Every person from every nation would worship Him!\n\nIn another vision, an angel named Gabriel came to Daniel. Gabriel explained that all these visions were about the END TIMES—what would happen before Jesus comes back.\n\nDaniel prayed a lot. One time, while he was praying about when God's people could go back to Jerusalem, Gabriel came again! He told Daniel about the Messiah who would come to save people from their sins. That Messiah was Jesus!\n\nIn Daniel's last big vision, he saw a man dressed in shining linen—maybe it was Jesus before He was born as a baby! The man's face was like lightning, and his eyes were like flaming torches! Daniel was so scared he fell down!\n\nBut the man touched Daniel and made him strong. He told Daniel about angels fighting battles we can't see. He told him about an angel named Michael who protects God's people. And he told him that one day, everyone who loves God will rise from the dead and shine like stars forever!\n\nGod told Daniel, 'Seal up this vision. It's about things far in the future. But you, Daniel, you will rest. And at the end of time, you'll rise again!'\n\nDaniel learned that God knows the whole future! God is in control of everything! And one day, God's kingdom will win, and everyone who loves God will live with Him forever and ever!"
