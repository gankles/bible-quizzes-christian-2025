This was the first day.\n\nOn the second day, God made the sky, stretching it like a tent between the waters above and below. On the third day, He gathered the waters into seas and made dry land appear. Then He filled the land with plants and trees bearing fruit with seeds.\n\nThe fourth day brought the sun to rule the day and the moon and stars to govern the night. On the fifth day, God filled the waters with fish and the skies with birds, blessing them to multiply. The sixth day saw land animals of every kind, and then the crowning act of creation.\n\n'Let Us make man in Our image,' God said. He formed Adam from the dust and breathed life into him. Male and female He created them, blessing them to be fruitful and giving them dominion over all the earth.\n\nGod looked at everything He had made, and it was very good. On the seventh day, He rested—not from weariness, but to establish a pattern of rest and worship for all time.",

He filled the oceans with fish—big ones and tiny ones! He filled the sky with birds that could sing and fly.\n\nThen God made all the animals—fuzzy ones, scaly ones, ones that hop, and ones that roar! But God wasn't done yet.\n\nGod made something extra special: people! He made the first man, Adam, and breathed life into him. God made people to be like Him, to love Him and take care of His beautiful world.\n\nGod looked at EVERYTHING He made and said, 'This is VERY good!' Then God rested.

In the middle stood two special trees: the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.\n\nGod gave Adam work to do—to tend the garden and keep it. But He also gave one command: 'You may eat from any tree in the garden, but you must not eat from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. If you do, you will surely die.'\n\nGod brought all the animals to Adam to be named. Whatever Adam called each creature, that became its name. But among all the animals, no suitable helper was found for Adam.\n\nSo the Lord caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep. He took one of Adam's ribs and formed a woman from it. When God brought her to Adam, he was overjoyed: 'This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.'\n\nAdam and Eve lived together in the garden without shame.

Adam named the elephants and the butterflies and the puppies and the birds. What a fun job!\n\nBut Adam was a little lonely. He didn't have anyone like him to be his friend. So God made Adam fall into a deep, deep sleep.\n\nWhile Adam slept, God took one of his ribs and made a woman! When Adam woke up and saw her, he was so happy! 'She's just right!' Adam said. He named her Eve.\n\nAdam and Eve lived together in the beautiful garden. They talked with God every day. They ate yummy fruit from the trees. They played with the animals.

He approached Eve with a question designed to plant doubt: 'Did God really say you must not eat from any tree in the garden?'\n\nEve corrected him: 'We may eat fruit from the trees, but God said we must not eat from the tree in the middle of the garden or even touch it, or we will die.'\n\n'You will not surely die,' the serpent hissed. 'God knows that when you eat it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.'\n\nEve looked at the fruit. It was beautiful. It looked delicious. And the serpent said it would make her wise. She took some and ate it. She gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate.\n\nImmediately their eyes were opened—but not as they expected. They realized they were naked and felt shame for the first time. They sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves.\n\nWhen they heard God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, they hid. 'Where are you?' God called.\n\nAdam answered, 'I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.'\n\n'Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree I commanded you not to eat from?'\n\nAdam blamed Eve. Eve blamed the serpent. God pronounced judgment on all three—the serpent would crawl on its belly, the woman would have pain in childbirth, and the man would toil against thorns and thistles until he returned to dust.\n\nBut in the midst of judgment came hope. God told the serpent that the woman's offspring would crush his head. God clothed Adam and Eve with animal skins—the first death, foreshadowing the sacrifice that would one day fully cover sin.\n\nThen God sent them out of Eden, placing cherubim and a flaming sword to guard the way to the Tree of Life. Paradise was lost, but a promise was given.",

She gave some to Adam, and he ate it too.\n\nOh no! Right away they felt different. They felt bad inside. They knew they had done something wrong. They tried to hide from God.\n\n'Adam, Eve, where are you?' God called.\n\nThey came out, feeling ashamed. 'We ate the fruit,' they admitted.\n\nGod was sad. Now there would be sadness and hard work and sickness in the world. Adam and Eve had to leave the beautiful garden.\n\nBut even though God was sad, He still loved them! He made them warm clothes. And He made a special promise: someday, someone from Eve's family would defeat the sneaky snake forever.\n\nThat someone was Jesus!"

'If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door. It desires to have you, but you must rule over it.'\n\nBut Cain did not rule over it. He said to his brother, 'Let's go out to the field.'

'I will wipe mankind from the face of the earth,' He said.\n\nBut Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time. He walked faithfully with God.\n\nGod told Noah His plan. 'I am going to bring floodwaters to destroy all life. But I will establish My covenant with you. Build an ark of cypress wood.' God gave Noah detailed instructions—the ark would be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high, with three decks and one door.\n\nNoah obeyed. For perhaps 100 years, he built. People must have mocked him—building a massive boat far from any sea! But Noah kept building and preaching righteousness.\n\nWhen the ark was finished, God told Noah to bring his family and two of every kind of animal—seven pairs of the clean animals—into the ark. They came to Noah, and he brought them in. Then the Lord shut the door.\n\nAfter seven days, the rain began. For forty days and forty nights, water poured from the sky and burst from the ground. The floodwaters rose until even the highest mountains were covered. Every living thing outside the ark perished.\n\nBut God remembered Noah. After 150 days, He sent a wind, and the waters began to recede. The ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. Noah sent out a raven, then a dove. When the dove returned with an olive leaf, Noah knew the earth was drying.\n\nFinally, God said, 'Come out of the ark.' Noah built an altar and offered sacrifices. God was pleased and made a covenant: 'Never again will I destroy all life with a flood.' He set His rainbow in the clouds as a sign of this everlasting promise.\n\nFrom Noah's three sons—Shem, Ham, and Japheth—all the nations of the earth descended.

But I will keep you safe. Build a big, big boat called an ark!'\n\nNoah obeyed God. He started building. BANG, BANG, BANG went his hammer! The boat was HUGE—as long as one and a half football fields! People probably laughed at Noah. 'Why are you building a boat? There's no water here!' But Noah kept building.\n\nWhen the ark was done, something amazing happened. Animals started coming! Two of every kind—elephants, giraffes, lions, bunnies, birds, bugs—all walked, flew, or crawled into the ark. Noah's family went in too: Noah, his wife, his three sons, and their wives.\n\nThen God shut the door. DRIP, DRIP, DRIP... then POUR! Rain fell and fell for forty days and forty nights. Water covered everything, even the mountains! But inside the ark, everyone was safe and dry.\n\nAfter a long, long time, the rain stopped. The water went down. Noah sent out a dove, and it came back with an olive leaf! The ground was getting dry!\n\nWhen they came out of the ark, Noah thanked God. Then something beautiful appeared in the sky—a RAINBOW! God said, 'This rainbow is My promise. I will never flood the whole earth again.'\n\nEvery time you see a rainbow, remember: God always keeps His promises!"

At that time, the whole world had one language.\n\nAs people migrated eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there. 'Come,' they said to each other, 'let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly.' They used brick instead of stone and tar for mortar.\n\nThen they said, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.'\n\nThis was not humble worship but proud rebellion. They wanted to make themselves great, to reach heaven by their own efforts, to stay together when God had commanded them to fill the earth.\n\nThe Lord came down to see the city and the tower they were building. 'If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this,' God said, 'then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let Us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.'\n\nSuddenly, workers could not understand one another. One asked for bricks and received strange sounds in reply. Arguments broke out. Confusion reigned. The work stopped.\n\nThe Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. It was called Babel—because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world.\n\nWhat man intended as a monument to human greatness became a reminder of human limitations. True unity comes not from opposing God but from submitting to Him.

They were building it to show off and be famous. That's called being proud.\n\nThey started stacking bricks higher and higher. 'Hand me more bricks!' 'We need more tar!' Everyone worked together... but for the wrong reason.\n\nGod saw what they were doing. He wasn't happy that they were being so proud. So God did something surprising.\n\nSuddenly, one worker said, 'Blibber blabber bloo!'\n\n'What?' said another worker. 'Snipper snapper snoo!'\n\n'Huh? What are you saying?!'\n\nNo one could understand each other anymore! God had mixed up their words! They couldn't work together. They couldn't finish the tower.\n\nThe people moved away to different places, speaking different languages. The city was called Babel, which sounds like 'babble'—mixed-up words!\n\nGod wanted people to spread out and fill the earth, not stay in one place being proud.
