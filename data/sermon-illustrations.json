            "content": "A pencil maker told his pencil, 'There are five things you need to know before I send you out into the world. Always remember them and you will become the best pencil you can be. One: You will be able to do many great things, but only if you allow yourself to be held in Someone's hand. Two: You will experience a painful sharpening from time to time, but you'll need it to become a better pencil. Three: You will be able to correct any mistakes you might make. Four: The most important part of you will always be what's inside. And Five: On every surface you are used on, you must leave your mark. No matter what the condition, you must continue to write.'\n\nThis is much like God's grace. We are held in His hand, sharpened by trials, forgiven of our mistakes (the eraser of grace), and defined by the Holy Spirit within us.",

He replied, 'Someone threw this at me years ago, and I decided to keep it as evidence of their cruelty.' He grew tired, his back bent, and he couldn't enjoy the scenery or shake hands with friends because his arms were full. Finally, a wise man told him, 'By carrying that stone, you are the one being punished, not the person who threw it.'\n\nForgiveness is not excusing the person; it is choosing to drop the stone so you can walk free.",
